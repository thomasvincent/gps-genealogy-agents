### Historical Significance

Archer L. Durham represents the generation of African American officers who advanced to senior leadership in the post-integration era:
- **1954**: Benjamin O. Davis Jr. became first Black USAF general
- **1975**: Daniel "Chappie" James Jr. became first Black four-star general
- **1984**: Durham promoted to Major General (two-star)

His career coincided with the transformation of military airlift from propeller aircraft (C-124, C-133) to jet transports (C-141, C-5), and he commanded the Air Force's only all-C-5 wing.
