Strategic roadmap for completing primary research

## Priority Level 1: CRITICAL (Complete This Week)

### 1. Bridget Joyce New Orleans Passenger List (1850-1854)
**Why This is #1 Priority:**
- Could reveal parents' names (may have traveled together)
- Could identify siblings (Irish families often emigrated in groups)
- May lead to New Orleans cemetery search (parents buried in St. Louis Cemetery No. 2?)
- Would explain why Bridget stayed in New Orleans until 1855 marriage
- Direct impact on understanding Brown-Joyce family origins

**Where to Search:**
- **NARA Microfilm M259**: *Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at New Orleans, 1820-1902*
- **Ancestry.com**: New Orleans Passenger Lists database
- **FamilySearch.org**: New Orleans Arrivals

**Search Parameters:**
| Field | Search Terms |
|-------|--------------|
| **Name** | Bridget Joyce, B. Joyce, Bridget Joice, variations |
| **Age at arrival** | 14-19 (assuming 1849-1854 arrival) |
| **Origin** | Ireland (Galway) or Liverpool (transfer point) |
| **Ship type** | "Cotton ships" from Liverpool to New Orleans |
| **Look for** | Joyce family clusters (multiple passengers with surname Joyce on same ship) |

**Search Strategy:**
1. Start with peak Famine years: **1850-1852**
2. Expand to 1849-1854 if not found
3. Check spelling variations: Joyce, Joice, Joyes
4. Look for full passenger list context (who else traveled with her?)

**Follow-up Actions if Parents Found:**
