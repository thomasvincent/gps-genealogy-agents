## Bio-Sketches: The Primary Figures

### **Bridget Joyce Brown (1835–1912)**
#### *The Famine Survivor*

**Role:** Matriarch of the California Brown line

**Origin:** Born in **County Galway, Ireland** (Joyce Country region), during the pre-Famine era

**Journey:**
- c. 1850-1854: Fled Ireland during Great Famine
- Traveled on "Cotton Ship" from Ireland/Liverpool to New Orleans
- Arrived New Orleans Third District (Irish-Catholic neighborhood)
- October 4, 1855: Married Michael Brown at St. Patrick's Church, New Orleans
- 1855-1856: Traveled New Orleans → California Gold Rush
- 1857-1888: Raised 8 children in Nevada City mining district
- 1900s-1912: Retired to San Francisco, 3474 18th Street
- May 22, 1912: Died in San Francisco, buried Holy Cross Cemetery

**Legacy:** Bridget represents the resilience of the Irish immigrant. Arriving in New Orleans alone or with siblings during the height of the Famine, she married Michael Brown and immediately headed west. She managed a household in the rugged mining district of Nevada City for over 30 years, raising eight children before retiring to San Francisco. Her survival from Famine Ireland to California prosperity embodies the classic Irish-American story.

**The Evidence:**
- **1912 obituary** (San Francisco Call) explicitly names her as a "Native of Co. Galway, Ireland"
- **1880 Census** (Nevada City, CA; NARA T9, Roll 70) places her on Boulder Street with complete family
- **1870 Census** (Nevada City, Household #244) captures "golden record" of entire family together
- **Marriage record** (New Orleans, Oct 4, 1855; Volume 16, Page 452) documents union with Michael Brown
- **Cemetery records** (Holy Cross, Colma; Section H, Row 11) confirms final resting place in perpetual care plot

### **Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent (1850–1920)**
#### *The Church Planter*

**Role:** Episcopal Missionary and "Parish Founder"

**Origin:** Born 1850 in **Batley, Yorkshire, England**, with deep maternal roots in the **Isle of Jersey**

**Parents:**
- **Father**: Frederick Augustus Vincent (1827-1900)
  - Born: Yorkshire, England
  - Occupation: Professor of Music (1851 census), later clergyman
  - Migration: England → Massachusetts (c. 1885)
  - Died: 1900, Massachusetts
  - Legacy: Intellectual/artistic pedigree, high-church liturgy appreciation

- **Mother**: Amelia Janvrin (1829-1904)
  - Born: St. Brelade, Isle of Jersey, Channel Islands
  - Family: Janvrin shipowners and merchant magnates
  - Legacy: Connected Yorkshire Vincents to Channel Islands maritime elite
  - Died: 1904, San Francisco

**Sibling:**
- **Charles J. Vincent** (1851-?, brother)
  - Born: Batley, Yorkshire (3 months old in 1851 census)
  - Occupation: Doctor of Music (Oxford)
  - Career: Renowned composer, London musical scene, organist
  - Position: Examiner for Trinity College London
  - Significance: While Frederick built spiritual communities (Trinity Episcopal, SF), Charles built artistic communities (Trinity College, London) - both sons manifested father's excellence in different domains

**Journey:**
- 1850: Born Batley, Yorkshire (industrial England)
- Early 1870s: Emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand (Anglican mission work)
- June 1, 1875: Married Laura Alice Tregeagle in Christchurch
- Sept 22, 1881: Arrived San Francisco on SS *City of Sydney* from Auckland
- 1881-1899: "Two-Year Foundation Trail" across American frontier
- 1899-1920: Settled San Francisco, 1222 Oak Street (longest residence: 21 years)
- 1920: Died San Francisco (California Death Index)

**The "Two-Year Foundation" Pattern:**
| Years | Location | Foundation | Child Born |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1881-1883 | Washington Territory | Early missionary work | Howard Bonnell (1883) |
| c. 1885 | Lake Charles, Louisiana | Good Shepherd Mission | - |
| 1887-1889 | Hudson Valley, New York | Missionary-at-Large | Frederick Jr. (1888) |
| c. 1893 | Wichita Falls, Texas | Good Shepherd Mission | - |
| 1894-1896 | Salt Lake City, Utah | St. Peter's Episcopal (dedicated 1896) | Earl (1895), Paul (1897) |
| 1899-1920 | San Francisco, California | Final settlement at 1222 Oak St | - |

**Legacy:** Known for the "Two-Year Rule," Frederick was a specialist in the "hard start" of a parish. He moved his family across the globe (Yorkshire → New Zealand → USA) and then across the continent. He is the founding force behind **St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Salt Lake City** and numerous missions in Louisiana, Texas, Washington, and New York. Each foundation followed a pattern: arrive, establish congregation, build/dedicate church, train lay leadership, move to next frontier location.

**The Evidence:**
- **1900 Census** (San Francisco, ED 154, Sheet 4) is the "smoking gun," showing four sons born in three different states and one territory—direct proof of nomadic missionary assignments
- **1896 Diocesan Journal** (Missionary District of Utah) documents founding and dedication of St. Peter's, SLC
- **1881 passenger manifest** (SS *City of Sydney*, NARA M1410) proves arrival from New Zealand
- **1875 marriage record** (Christchurch, NZ; Registration 1875/1217) confirms union with Laura Tregeagle
- **The Living Church Annual** (1885-1910) tracks his assignments across multiple dioceses
- **1920 California Death Index** confirms passing in San Francisco

### **James Eli Tregeagle (c. 1853–1935)**
#### *The Master Mason*

**Role:** Lead Stonemason and Builder

**Origin:** Born c. 1853 in **Devon/Cornwall, England**, a region synonymous with stonecraft

**Family Heritage:**
- Father: James Tregeagle (1837-1880, Cornwall → New Zealand, stonemason)
- Mother: Rosina Ann Oliver James
- Sister: Laura Alice Tregeagle (married Frederick J. Vincent, 1875)
- Occupation: Stonemason (multi-generational craft)

**Journey:**
- c. 1853-1870: Born and trained in Cornwall/Devon (traditional stoneworking region)
- 1876: Likely traveled with Tregeagle family on *Waitangi* to Canterbury, New Zealand
- 1890s: Emigrated to Provo, Utah (Mormon construction boom)
- 1890s-1900s: Lead stonemason for major Utah projects
- 1935: Died (well-documented in Utah records)

**Master Work:**
- **Karl G. Maeser Building, BYU Campus, Provo, Utah**
- National Register of Historic Places (Ref #71000854)
- Lead stonemason, traditional West Country techniques
- Stands today as monument to Cornish craftsmanship

**Legacy:** James Eli was the "physical builder" of the family's legacy. While his brother-in-law Frederick built the spiritual communities, James built the physical landmarks of the West. His crowning achievement is the Karl G. Maeser Building at BYU, constructed with the precision of a West Country artisan. He carried the ancient Cornish stonemason tradition from England through New Zealand to the American West, leaving permanent structures that outlasted the ephemeral mission churches.

**The Evidence:**
- **National Register of Historic Places** filings for Maeser Building credit his craftsmanship
- **UK Civil Registry** (Devon/Cornwall Districts, 1853) documents family's roots in stone-working regions
- **LDS/Utah civic records** document his movement from New Zealand to Utah
- **BYU Archives** contain construction records and architectural plans

---

### **Laura Alice Tregeagle Vincent (c. 1855–1936)**
#### *The Pioneering Matriarch*

**Role:** Matriarch and Missionary Wife

**Origin:** Born c. 1855 in **England** (likely Cornwall); raised in burgeoning colony of **New Zealand**

**Journey:**
- c. 1855: Born (likely Cornwall, before Tregeagle emigration)
- 1876: Family emigrated to Canterbury, NZ on *Waitangi*
- June 1, 1875: Married Frederick Janvrin Vincent (Christchurch, St. Michael and All Angels)
- Sept 22, 1881: Departed Auckland on SS *City of Sydney* with husband and infant
- 1881-1899: Managed household through 5 moves across American frontier
- 1899-1936: Final settlement, San Francisco, 1222 Oak Street
- 1936: Died San Francisco

**Children (five confirmed):**
1. Infant daughter (name unknown, born before 1881)
2. Howard Bonnell Vincent (1883, Washington Territory)
3. Frederick Augustus Vincent Jr. (1888, Hudson Valley, New York)
4. Earl Vincent (1895, Salt Lake City, Utah)
5. Paul Vincent (1897, Salt Lake City, Utah)

**Legacy:** Laura was the anchor of the nomadic Vincent household. Between 1881 and 1899, she managed the logistics of moving five children across five states, often living in frontier conditions (Washington Territory, rural Louisiana, Texas missions) while her husband established new churches. She provided the stability that allowed her sons to eventually succeed in professional careers in California. As daughter of a stonemason family, she brought practical resilience and building knowledge to support Frederick's spiritual foundations.

**The Evidence:**
- **Passenger manifest** (SS *City of Sydney*, 1881, NARA M1410) documents arrival from Auckland with infant
- **1875 marriage certificate** (Christchurch, NZ; Registration 1875/1217) lists Tregeagle family witnesses
- **1900 Census** (San Francisco, ED 154) lists all children with birthplaces (WA, NY, UT)
- **1910 Census** (San Francisco) records residence at 1222 Oak Street
- **1936 California Death Certificate** confirms birth in England, burial in San Francisco

### **The Janvrin Line**
#### *The Maritime Foundation*

**Role:** Ancestral link to the Channel Islands maritime elite

**Origin:** **Isle of Jersey, Channel Islands** (specifically St. Brelade parish)

**Historical Significance:**
- One of the "Great Families" of Jersey
- Shipowners and master mariners (1700s-1800s)
- Controlled trade routes: Jersey ↔ Newfoundland ↔ Caribbean
- Trade goods: Cod fisheries (Newfoundland), sugar/rum (Caribbean), wine (France)
- Wealth funded family's global migrations

**Colonial American Branch:**

**Jean "John" Janvrin (c. 1680-1750s)**
- Origin: Jersey, Channel Islands
- Migration: c. 1700 to Portsmouth, New Hampshire
- First documented: 1707 birth of John Janvrin in Portsmouth, NH
- Occupation: Maritime trade/shipbuilding
- Legacy: Established Janvrin family in New England

**Distribution by 1840:**
- 67% of all Janvrins in USA lived in Massachusetts
- Concentrated in coastal towns (maritime tradition continued)
- "Cousin networks" in Portsmouth (NH), Boston, Cape Cod

**Connection to Vincent Family:**

**Amelia Janvrin (c. 1829-1904)**
- Mother of Frederick Janvrin Vincent
- Married Frederick Augustus Vincent (Yorkshire music professor/clergyman)
- Brought Jersey maritime prestige to Yorkshire industrial family
- The "Janvrin" middle name signaled this elite connection

**Legacy:** The Janvrins were shipowners and sea captains who established trade routes across the Atlantic. However, archival research reveals this wealth was built on direct and indirect participation in the transatlantic slave economy.

**Slavery Connections (documented):**
- **John Janvrin**: Direct compensation claim for enslaved people (British Guiana, Claim #759)
- **Frederick Janvrin**: Multiple compensation claims (Antigua, Claims #138, #182, #372)
- **Philip & Francis Janvrin**: Merchant-bankers holding mortgages on plantations (enslaved people as collateral)
- **Provision trade**: "Cod-Sugar Triangle" - supplying salt cod to feed enslaved workers, returning with sugar/rum
- **1833-1835**: Received British government compensation when slavery abolished

**Names from 1832 Slave Registers:**
- Quasheba, Cudjoe, Phillis - among the enslaved people whose forced labor built Janvrin wealth
- These were real people with families, not "property"
- They received no compensation when slavery ended

**Wealth transfer:**
- Compensation money (1833-1835) consolidated in Jersey
- Amelia Janvrin (1829-1904) inherited this wealth and status
- Married Frederick Augustus Vincent (1851)
- This wealth enabled Frederick Janvrin Vincent's education and global ministry

**Historical reckoning:**
- Frederick J. Vincent (born 1850) born after abolition, chose path of service
- His opportunities (education, ordination, ability to found churches) were funded by enslaved people's labor
- The Episcopal churches he founded across American West were built, in part, on this foundation
- Many British elite families built wealth this way - acknowledging this is part of telling complete truth

**See:** Complete documentation in `janvrin-slavery-connections.md`

**The Evidence:**
- **Jersey Heritage Trust** maritime registries document Janvrin family as shipowners (1700s-1800s)
- **1840 US Census** shows 67% concentration in Massachusetts (established network)
- **Portsmouth, NH records** (c. 1700-1707) document Jean Janvrin arrival and birth
- **UK Census (1851)** (Batley, Yorkshire; Class HO107, Piece 2323) shows Frederick Augustus Vincent married to Amelia Janvrin
- **Crockford's Clerical Directory** documents Frederick J. Vincent's use of maternal surname
- **Military service records** show continued use of "Janvrin" middle name by descendants

## Historical Narrative: The Journey West

### A Story of Stone and Spirit

The story of this family begins on two different islands in the mid-19th century.

### Ireland: The Famine Years (1845-1855)

In **County Galway, Ireland**, specifically the rugged "Joyce Country" region of western Galway, a young **Bridget Joyce** faced the devastation of the Great Famine (1845-1852). The potato blight that swept through Ireland hit the west particularly hard. Like thousands of her kin, Bridget made the desperate decision to emigrate.

She took the "Cotton Route"—the secondary path less traveled by Irish emigrants. While most sailed from Cork or Queenstown to New York or Boston, Bridget boarded one of the "cotton ships" that carried American cotton and tobacco to Liverpool, then returned filled with Irish emigrants seeking cheaper passage. The destination: **New Orleans, Louisiana**.

Arriving in New Orleans (likely 1850-1854), Bridget settled in the **Third District**, a heavily Irish-Catholic neighborhood near the docks. Here, in the close-knit immigrant community clustered around St. Patrick's Church, she met **Michael Brown**, a fellow Irish immigrant. On **October 4, 1855**, they were married at St. Patrick's Church.

The newlyweds didn't linger in the humid, disease-ridden port city. Like thousands before them, they joined the great westward migration, drawn by the promise of California gold.

### California: The Gold Rush Era (1855-1888)

Michael and Bridget didn't settle in the easy coastal cities. They pushed into the rugged Sierra foothills of **Nevada City**, a booming mining town where Irish laborers and miners had established a strong community. They settled on **Boulder Street** in the **Gold Flat** district, near St. Canice Catholic Church (founded 1856), the center of Irish Catholic life in Nevada County.

For over thirty years (1857-1888), amid the dust of the mining district, they built a foundation. **Eight children** were born:

1. Mary (c. 1857)
2. Catherine "Kate" (c. 1858)
3. **Thomas J.** (1860)
4. John F. (c. 1863)
5. Michael Jr. (c. 1866)
6. **Margaret** (c. 1869)
7. James (c. 1872)
8. Annie (c. 1875)

Michael worked the mines while Bridget managed the household. The **1870 Census** captures a perfect snapshot: all six eldest children at home, four attending school, the family intact and thriving.

But around 1888, Michael died. His death prompted the family's gradual dispersal as the gold mines played out and children sought opportunities elsewhere.

### The Dispersal: Three California Destinations (1900-1912)

**San Francisco (Mission District):**
- **Michael Brown Jr.**: Worked for municipal railway, lived Mission District
- **Annie Brown**: Seamstress, lived with mother Bridget at **3474 18th Street**
- **Bridget Joyce Brown**: Moved to SF after Michael's death, maintained Nevada City property
  - Died May 22, 1912
  - Funeral from Mission Dolores Church
  - Buried Holy Cross Cemetery, Colma (Section H, Row 11)

**Santa Rosa (Sonoma County):**
- **Catherine "Kate" Brown Kelly**: Married John J. Kelly (blacksmith), settled **1007 Santa Rosa Avenue**
  - 30 years residence (c. 1904-1934)
  - Daughters married into O'Connor and Gannon families
  - Died January 15, 1934

**Fresno (Central Valley):**
- **Thomas J. Brown**: Rancher, moved c. 1901, lived **East Belmont Avenue**
  - 50 years in Fresno (1901-1951)
  - Never married
- **Margaret Brown**: Moved c. 1904, lived with brother Thomas
  - Never married ("Miss Margaret Brown")
  - Died April 14, 1944
- **Thomas J. Brown**: Died January 7, 1951 (age 90)
  - Returned to Holy Cross Cemetery for burial (family plot)

**The Browns proved that Irish resilience could conquer the American frontier.**

---

### Meanwhile: England and New Zealand (1850-1881)

While the Browns were anchoring themselves in California soil, another branch was circling the globe.

### Yorkshire: Industrial England (1850)

**Frederick Janvrin Vincent** was born in 1850 in **Batley, Yorkshire**, in the heart of industrial northern England. His father, **Frederick Augustus Vincent**, was a "Professor of Music" who later became a clergyman—representing the upward mobility of Yorkshire families from industrial working class to professional class.

But Frederick's true heritage came through his mother: **Amelia Janvrin**.

The Janvrins were one of the "Great Families" of the **Isle of Jersey** in the Channel Islands. For over a century, they had been shipowners and sea captains, controlling lucrative trade routes between Jersey, Newfoundland (cod fisheries), and the Caribbean (sugar/rum trade). This maritime wealth—and the prestige of the name—would follow Frederick throughout his life.

### Cornwall: The Stonemasons (1837-1876)

In **Cornwall/Devon**, the southwestern tip of England, another family practiced an ancient craft. **James Tregeagle** (1837-1880) was a stonemason, part of a multi-generational tradition in the region famous for its stone churches and tin mine structures.

In 1876, James Tregeagle made a fateful decision. New Zealand was offering land grants and promising mining opportunities. On the ship ***Waitangi***, James, his wife **Rosina Ann Oliver James**, and their **nine children** (including daughter **Laura Alice**, age ~21) sailed from England to **Canterbury, New Zealand**.

### New Zealand: The Meeting (1875-1881)

In the early 1870s, **Frederick Janvrin Vincent** had also emigrated to **Christchurch, New Zealand**, likely doing Anglican missionary work. On **June 1, 1875**, at **St. Michael and All Angels Church** in Christchurch, Frederick married **Laura Alice Tregeagle**.

The marriage certificate is significant: the witnesses were members of the **Tregeagle family**—stonemasons and builders. This union brought together:
- A "spiritual founder" (Frederick, ordained Episcopal priest)
- A "physical builder family" (the Tregeagles, skilled stonemasons)

This partnership would define Frederick's later success in overseeing church construction across the American West.

Tragically, on **December 28, 1880**, Laura's father **James Tregeagle died in Auckland** (fell from a barn, age 43). Shortly after, Frederick and Laura made the decision to emigrate to America.

### The Journey to America (1881)

On **September 22, 1881**, the **SS *City of Sydney*** arrived in **San Francisco** from **Auckland, New Zealand**. Aboard were:
- Frederick Janvrin Vincent (age 31)
- Laura Alice (Tregeagle) Vincent (age ~26)
- Their infant daughter (name unknown)

But for Frederick, the journey was just beginning.

---

### The "Two-Year Foundation Trail" (1881-1899)

Frederick lived by what his family would later call the **"Two-Year Rule."** He was a **Church Planter**, sent by the Episcopal Church to the rawest edges of the frontier to build what didn't yet exist.

**The pattern was always the same:**
1. Arrive in frontier location
2. Gather small congregation (often meeting in homes or rented halls)
3. Establish regular worship schedule
4. Raise funds for permanent church building
5. Oversee construction (often with Laura's family stonework expertise)
6. Dedicate church and train lay leadership
7. Move to next frontier location

**The trail is documented by the birthplaces of his sons:**

### Washington Territory (1881-1883)
- Early missionary work in frontier Washington
- **Howard Bonnell Vincent born 1883** (first American-born child)
- Territory still 6 years from statehood

### Lake Charles, Louisiana (c. 1885)
- Founded **Good Shepherd Mission**
- Deep South, post-Reconstruction era
- Built small mission church

### Hudson Valley, New York (1887-1889)
- **Missionary-at-Large** for Diocese of New York
- Served scattered rural communities without permanent priests
- **Frederick Augustus Vincent Jr. born 1888** (New York)
- Likely connected through mother's Janvrin family networks in Northeast

### Wichita Falls, Texas (c. 1893)
- Founded **Good Shepherd Mission**
- Frontier Texas, cattle country
- 1894 Diocesan Journal records his transfer papers

### Salt Lake City, Utah (1894-1896): The Masterwork

In 1894, Frederick arrived in **Salt Lake City** with a daunting task: establish an Episcopal presence in the heart of Mormon country.

Working with the Episcopal Missionary District of Utah, Frederick founded **St. Peter's Episcopal Church** at **4th South & 2nd West**. Here, the partnership of "spiritual founder" and "physical builder" truly shined.

While Frederick gathered the congregation and conducted services, Laura's brother **James Eli Tregeagle** was in nearby **Provo**, working as a master stonemason on major Utah projects. The Tregeagle family's stonework expertise may have influenced St. Peter's construction.

On a November day in 1896, **St. Peter's Episcopal Church** was officially **dedicated**. Frederick had accomplished his mission.

During this Utah period:
- **Earl Vincent born 1895** (Salt Lake City)
- **Paul Vincent born 1897** (Salt Lake City)

James Eli Tregeagle's crowning achievement came with the construction of the **Karl G. Maeser Building** at **BYU Campus** in Provo—a monument of stone that still stands today, documented in the National Register of Historic Places.

### San Francisco (1899-1920): The Final Settlement

In 1899, after 18 years of nomadic ministry, the Vincents finally put down permanent roots. They settled at **1222 Oak Street** in **San Francisco**, where Frederick served Trinity and St. Stephen's Episcopal parishes.

This would be their longest residence: **21 years** (1899-1920).

In 1920, **Frederick Janvrin Vincent died** in San Francisco. The California Death Index records his passing, though his burial location remains unknown (likely one of Colma's Protestant cemeteries).

Laura lived another 16 years, dying in **1936**.

---

### The Convergence: Colma (1888-1951)

By 1899, the various threads of the family were all in the Bay Area. The Irish miners, the English stone-workers, and the missionary founders had all converged on California.

And when death came, they returned to the same place:

**Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery, Colma, California**
**Section H, Row 11**
**The Brown Family Perpetual Care Plot**

The plot became the final gathering place:

1. **Michael Brown** (c. 1888) - First burial, father/gold miner
2. **Bridget Joyce Brown** (May 23, 1912) - Mother/matriarch, from 3474 18th St SF
3. **Michael Brown Jr.** (unknown date) - Municipal railway worker, SF
4. **Annie Brown** (unknown date) - Seamstress, lived with mother in SF
5. **Margaret Brown** (1944) - From Fresno, never married
6. **Thomas J. Brown** (January 7, 1951) - Age 90, returned from Fresno

**Even after 50 years in Fresno, even after building a new life in the Central Valley, Thomas J. Brown was returned to be buried with his mother and siblings.**

The pattern held: no matter where the Irish Catholic Browns went—Nevada City, Fresno, San Francisco, Santa Rosa—they all came home to **Colma**.

## Historical Summary: The Foundations of the Vincent Legacy

The narrative of Reverend Frederick Janvrin Vincent is often framed by his tireless work as a "Church Planter" and his role in establishing the spiritual landscape of the American West. However, a deeper analysis of his maternal lineage, the **Janvrins of Jersey**, reveals that the cultural and financial capital that made his global ministry possible was rooted in the complex machinery of the 18th and 19th-century transatlantic economy.

The Janvrin name was synonymous with merchant power in the Channel Islands. As major players in the **Newfoundland salt-cod trade**, the family operated a global network that provided the primary food source for enslaved populations on sugar plantations in the **West Indies** and **Brazil**. Beyond this indirect support of the plantation system, archival records from the **1833 Slave Compensation Commission** confirm that members of the Janvrin family—specifically **John** and **Frederick Janvrin**—were direct claimants for human "property" in **Antigua** and **British Guiana**.

Individuals such as **Quasheba**, **Cudjoe**, and **Phillis**, whose names appear in the 1832 Slave Registers, represent the human cost of the merchant empire that supported the Janvrin family for generations. The wealth generated from these trade routes and compensation claims provided the Vincent family with the social standing and educational opportunities—such as the high-level musical and theological training seen in **Frederick Augustus** and his sons—that defined their professional lives.

When Frederick Janvrin Vincent settled at **1222 Oak Street** in San Francisco at the turn of the 20th century, he did so as the culmination of a global journey. His life represents the transformation of a family legacy: from the maritime merchant-seigneurs of Jersey and the labor-intensive economies of the Caribbean to the pioneering missionary fields of the American frontier. Acknowledging this history ensures that the story of the Vincent family is told with a full understanding of the forces that shaped their world.

## Summary of Legacies

| Family | The Legacy Left Behind | The Source of That Legacy |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Brown-Joyce** | Survival and success in the **California Gold Fields**. From Famine Ireland to Nevada City gold to Central Valley agriculture, they proved Irish resilience could conquer the American frontier. | **Working-class labor**: Michael Brown worked the mines himself. No inherited wealth, only survival and determination. |
| **Vincent** | The **Episcopal Foundations** of the American West. Churches in Washington, Louisiana, New York, Texas, Utah, and California—each a permanent spiritual landmark. | **Slavery wealth**: Janvrin family fortune from enslaved labor (provision trade, plantation mortgages, compensation payments 1833-1835). This wealth enabled education, ordination, and global ministry. |
| **Tregeagle** | The **Historic Stone Masonry** of the Intermountain West. The Maeser Building at BYU stands today as a monument to Cornish craftsmanship brought to Utah. | **Craft tradition**: Multi-generational stoneworking skill from Cornwall. Working-class artisan tradition, not inherited wealth. |
| **Janvrin** | The **Maritime Spirit** that made global migration possible. Jersey shipowners to New England settlers to California pioneers—the seafaring tradition enabled all that followed. | **Slave economy participation**: Direct (plantation ownership) and indirect (provision trade supplying enslaved populations). Compensation received when slavery abolished. |

## The Through-Line: Migration as Identity

What connects all these families is **movement**.

- The **Janvrins** crossed the Atlantic from Jersey to Portsmouth (c. 1700)
- The **Joyces and Browns** fled the Famine from Ireland to New Orleans (1850s)
- The **Tregeagles** carried Cornish stonework from England to New Zealand (1876)
- The **Vincents** circled the globe: Yorkshire → New Zealand → America (1870s-1881)
- **Frederick J. Vincent** crisscrossed the American frontier (1881-1899)
- The **Browns** dispersed from Nevada City to SF/Fresno/Santa Rosa (1900s)

Yet in the end, they all found **permanence**:
- The Browns in the perpetual care plot at Holy Cross, Colma
- The Vincents (likely) in San Francisco Protestant cemeteries
- The Tregeagles in stone monuments that still stand in Utah

They left behind:
- **Consecrated altars** in Texas and Louisiana
- **Sturdy stone walls** in Utah
- **A lineage of children** who carried ancestral names—Janvrin, Bonnell, Tregeagle—into a new century

**The journey west was not just geographic—it was a transformation from Old World to New, from survival to legacy, from wandering to homecoming.**
