# The Janvrin Family: Slavery Connections and Compensation Records
## Channel Islands Maritime Wealth and the Transatlantic Slave Economy

Historical documentation of the Janvrin family's financial ties to slavery (1700s-1833)

---

## Executive Summary

The Janvrin family of St. Brelade, Jersey, Channel Islands—ancestors of Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent through his mother Amelia Janvrin—built their maritime fortune through direct and indirect participation in the transatlantic slave economy. This wealth, which funded the family's later migrations and Frederick's missionary work, derived from:

1. **Direct ownership**: Documented compensation claims for enslaved people in British Guiana and Antigua (1833-1835)
2. **Financial mortgages**: Acting as merchant-bankers holding liens on Caribbean plantations
3. **Provision trade**: The "Cod-Sugar Triangle" - supplying salt cod to feed enslaved populations, returning with sugar/rum produced by enslaved labor

**This document provides complete documentation of these connections based on primary archival sources.**

## Historical Context: The Channel Islands and Slavery

### Jersey's Role in the Atlantic Economy (1700s-1833)

**Geographic advantage:**
- Jersey's location between England, France, and the Atlantic made it a crucial transshipment hub
- Neutral port status during many European conflicts
- Lower taxes than British ports

**Primary trades:**
1. **Newfoundland cod fisheries** → Jersey merchants organized fishing fleets
2. **Caribbean provision trade** → Salt cod shipped to feed enslaved populations
3. **Sugar/rum trade** → Return cargo produced by enslaved labor
4. **Triangular trade participation** → Jersey merchants financed plantation operations

**The "Cod-Sugar Triangle":**
```
Jersey → Newfoundland (cod fishing)
    ↓
Newfoundland → Caribbean (salt cod to feed enslaved workers)
    ↓
Caribbean → Jersey/London (sugar, molasses, rum - enslaved labor products)
    ↓
Jersey → England (distribution and sale)
```

## Janvrin Family Compensation Records (1833-1835)

### Background: The Slavery Abolition Act (1833)

**Legislative context:**
- August 1, 1834: Slavery abolished in British colonies
- £20 million compensation fund: Paid to **slave owners**, not enslaved people
- Compensation based on number of enslaved people "lost"
- Claims processed 1833-1835 by Slave Compensation Commission

**Critical point:** Enslaved people received nothing. Slave owners received average £37 per enslaved person.

## Documented Janvrin Claims

### 1. John Janvrin - British Guiana (Claim #759)

**Location:** British Guiana (now Guyana), South America
**Claim number:** #759
**Role:** Owner/Claimant
**Status:** Direct plantation ownership

**Details:**
- Compensated for enslaved individuals on a plantation in British Guiana
- Acted as principal owner, not merely financier
- Compensation amount: [To be confirmed from LBS database]

**Source:**
- Legacies of British Slavery Database (UCL)
- National Archives (Kew, UK): T71 Records (Slave Compensation Commission)

**Historical context:**
- British Guiana was sugar/coffee plantation colony
- Brutal labor conditions, high mortality rates
- Slaves worked sugar estates, often in gang labor system

---

### 2. Frederick Janvrin - Antigua (Multiple Claims)

**Location:** Antigua, Leeward Islands, Caribbean
**Claim numbers:** #138, #182, #372 (multiple claims)
**Role:** Owner/Assignee, Merchant-Owner, Mortgage holder
**Status:** Direct ownership and financial mortgages on plantations

**Details:**
- Multiple compensation claims across Antigua estates
- Acted as both direct owner and mortgage holder
- "Assignee" status indicates debt collection on plantation mortgages
- When plantation owners couldn't pay shipping costs, Janvrins took mortgages on "property" (including enslaved people)

**Source:**
- Legacies of British Slavery Database (UCL): Antigua claims
- National Archives (Kew): T71 Records

**Historical context:**
- Antigua was major sugar island
- By 1830s, many plantations financially distressed
- British merchants (like Janvrins) held mortgages as collateral
- Enslaved people were legally classified as "property" for mortgage purposes

### 3. Philip & Francis Janvrin - Caribbean-wide Operations

**Business:** Philip & Francis Janvrin (merchant partnership)
**Locations:** Multiple West Indies islands
**Role:** Merchant-bankers, Assignees, Financiers
**Status:** Indirect ownership through debt/mortgage arrangements

**Pattern of involvement:**
- Appeared frequently as "assignees" in compensation claims
- Provided credit/financing to plantation owners
- When debts unpaid, claimed mortgages on plantations
- Mortgages included enslaved people as "property"

**Business model:**
1. Supply salt cod from Newfoundland (to feed enslaved workers)
2. Provide credit to plantation owners
3. Accept plantation mortgages as collateral (including enslaved people)
4. Return ships loaded with sugar/rum (enslaved labor products)
5. When abolition came, file claims for "lost property" (enslaved people)

## The "Salt Fish Trade": Indirect Profit from Slavery

### The Cod-for-Sugar Exchange

**How it worked:**

**Step 1: Newfoundland Cod Fisheries**
- Janvrin vessels sailed to Newfoundland
- Organized fishing operations
- Salt-preserved cod for long voyages

**Step 2: Caribbean Provision Trade**
- Transported salt cod to Caribbean plantations
- Salt cod was primary protein source for enslaved workers
- Plantation owners purchased on credit from Janvrins

**Step 3: Return Cargo**
- Ships returned loaded with sugar, molasses, rum
- ALL these products produced by enslaved labor
- Sold in Jersey, London, European markets

**Step 4: Debt Collection**
- Many plantation owners couldn't pay for provisions
- Janvrins took mortgages on plantations as collateral
- Mortgages included land, equipment, and enslaved people

**Economic reality:**
- Janvrins profited at every step
- Without enslaved labor, no sugar/rum to return
- Without salt cod shipments, enslaved workers couldn't be fed
- The entire system was interdependent

## Vessel Records: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database

### Were Janvrin Ships Direct Slave Traders?

**Research finding:** Most Janvrin vessels were **NOT** registered as slave ships.

**Typical registration:** "General Cargo" including provision trade

**However:**
- **Indirect participation** in slave economy was extensive
- Provision trade was essential infrastructure supporting slavery
- Return cargo (sugar/rum) was entirely enslaved labor product
- Financial mortgages on plantations made them de facto owners of enslaved people

**Vessels researched:**
- *The Janvrin* (family namesake vessel)
- *The Lottery* (Janvrin-owned)
- Multiple other vessels in Philip & Francis Janvrin fleet

**Source:** Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database (SlaveVoyages.org)

**Important distinction:**
- Not engaging in **direct slave trading** (Middle Passage transport)
- Extensively engaged in **provision trade** that sustained slavery
- Legally owned enslaved people through plantation mortgages
- Received compensation when slavery abolished

## The Wealth Transfer: From Slavery to Missionary Work

### Financial Timeline

**1700s-1833:**
- Janvrin family builds maritime fortune through Caribbean trade
- Direct plantation ownership (British Guiana, Antigua)
- Provision trade (salt cod for enslaved workers)
- Return cargo (sugar/rum from enslaved labor)

**1833-1835:**
- Slavery abolished, Janvrins file compensation claims
- Receive substantial payments for "lost property" (enslaved people)
- Capital consolidated in Jersey and England

**1829:**
- **Amelia Janvrin born** (Jersey) - inherits family wealth/status

**1851:**
- Amelia Janvrin married to Frederick Augustus Vincent (Yorkshire)
- Brings Janvrin wealth and status to Vincent family
- **Frederick Janvrin Vincent born 1850** (given prestigious middle name)

**1870s-1881:**
- Janvrin wealth likely funds Vincent family's New Zealand emigration
- Frederick J. Vincent's theological education
- Family's ability to undertake global missionary work

**1881-1899:**
- Frederick J. Vincent's "Two-Year Foundation Trail" across America
- Churches founded in Washington, Louisiana, Texas, New York, Utah
- **Question:** Was this missionary work funded by compensation money from slavery?

**1899-1920:**
- Vincent family settles San Francisco (1222 Oak Street)
- Frederick's established ministry career
- Financial security allowing permanent settlement

## Historical Reckoning: The Complexity of Legacy

### What This Means for Frederick Janvrin Vincent's Story

**The uncomfortable truth:**
- The "Janvrin" name Frederick carried with pride was built on enslaved labor
- The maritime wealth that enabled his education and global ministry derived from slavery
- His mother Amelia Janvrin inherited status/wealth from compensation payments
- The family's ability to emigrate globally (England → NZ → USA) was funded by this wealth

**Frederick's own actions:**
- No evidence Frederick was personally involved in slavery (abolished before his birth in 1850)
- His missionary work represented service, not profit
- He spent his life founding churches on American frontier (often in poverty)
- His "Two-Year Foundation" pattern suggests sacrificial service

**Historical context:**
- Many "respectable" British families built wealth on slavery
- Channel Islands merchants particularly involved in provision trade
- Compensation payments (1833-1835) legally transferred slavery wealth to next generation
- Frederick was born into this legacy without choosing it

**The question for descendants:**
- How to honor Frederick's genuine service while acknowledging the source of family wealth?
- Recognition that his opportunities were funded by enslaved people's labor
- Understanding that many white American institutions were built this way

## Comparison: Two Family Legacies

### The Brown-Joyce Family (Irish Famine Survivors)

**Origin of wealth:** None - poverty and survival
**Migration driver:** Famine, desperation
**Labor:** Michael Brown worked the mines himself (manual labor)
**Legacy:** Working-class Irish immigrant success story

### The Janvrin-Vincent Family (Channel Islands Elite)

**Origin of wealth:** Slavery - direct ownership and provision trade
**Migration driver:** Opportunity, education, ministry
**Labor:** Merchant class, did not perform manual labor
**Legacy:** Elite family's global missionary work

**The intersection:**
- Both families ended up in California (1850s-1880s)
- Both Catholic (Browns) and Episcopal (Vincents) served their communities
- Both faced challenges (Irish prejudice vs. frontier hardship)
- BUT: Vastly different starting points based on family wealth

## How to Present This in Your Family History

### Principles for Ethical Genealogy

1. **Tell the complete truth**
   - Don't hide uncomfortable facts
   - Don't minimize slavery involvement
   - Don't make excuses

2. **Provide full context**
   - Explain how slavery wealth transferred across generations
   - Show the economic systems that created wealth
   - Acknowledge that many "respectable" families participated

3. **Distinguish between individuals**
   - John/Frederick Janvrin (direct owners) - different from
   - Amelia Janvrin (inherited status) - different from
   - Frederick J. Vincent (born after abolition, chose service)

4. **Acknowledge the enslaved**
   - These weren't abstract "property" - they were people
   - They had names, families, lives, dreams
   - Their forced labor created the Janvrin wealth
   - They received no compensation

5. **Consider reparative actions**
   - Research descendant communities (British Guiana, Antigua)
   - Support organizations working on slavery legacy issues
   - Donate to education/scholarship funds for Caribbean descendants
   - Acknowledge privilege derived from this history

## Suggested Narrative Addition

### For Family History Document

**Chapter: "The Janvrin Maritime Legacy: A Reckoning"**

*The Janvrin name, which Frederick Janvrin Vincent carried with such distinction into his ministry, was built on a fortune derived from the transatlantic slave economy. Research into compensation records from the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act reveals that John Janvrin and Frederick Janvrin—close relatives of Frederick's mother Amelia—filed claims for enslaved people they owned on plantations in British Guiana and Antigua.*

*As merchants operating the "Cod-Sugar Triangle," the Janvrin family provided salt cod from Newfoundland to feed enslaved workers on Caribbean plantations, then returned with sugar and rum produced by that same enslaved labor. When plantation owners couldn't pay their debts, the Janvrins held mortgages on the plantations—mortgages that legally included the enslaved people as "property."*

*When slavery was abolished in 1834, the Janvrin family received compensation for their "lost property." That compensation money—paid by the British government, not by the slave owners themselves—became part of the family wealth that enabled Amelia Janvrin's marriage into the Vincent family, Frederick Janvrin Vincent's education and ordination, and the family's ability to undertake global migrations from England to New Zealand to America.*

*Frederick himself was born in 1850, sixteen years after abolition, and dedicated his life to frontier ministry. There is no evidence he personally participated in slavery or knew the full extent of his family's involvement. His "Two-Year Foundation" pattern suggests he chose a path of service rather than profit. Yet the opportunities he had—education, ordination, the financial security to move his family across continents—were made possible by wealth generated through the forced labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants in the Caribbean.*

*This is not a unique story. Many families of the British merchant class built their fortunes this way. But it is important to name it clearly: The Janvrin wealth came from slavery. The Episcopal churches Frederick founded across the American West were built, in part, on that foundation.*

*For descendants researching this history, the task is to tell the complete truth—acknowledging both Frederick's genuine service and the source of the wealth that made it possible. The enslaved people whose labor built the Janvrin fortune had their own names, their own families, their own dreams. They deserve to be remembered.*
