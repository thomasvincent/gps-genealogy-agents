# John Jeffery Disambiguation Checklist
## Quick-Reference Action Plan

**Research Subject**: John Jeffery (b. ~1803, England)
**Critical Issue**: Multiple individuals with same name conflated in tree
**Goal**: Determine which John Jeffery is the research subject
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Budget**: £25-75

---

## The Question

**Which John Jeffery are we researching?**

### 🅰️ Candidate A: John Jeffery of Kent
- Born: 1803, Brenchley, Kent, England
- Died: 1868, Tonbridge, Kent, England (age 65)
- Parents: Edward Jeffery & Lydia Hickmott
- Pattern: **Remained in England entire life**
- Source: WikiTree Jeffery-538 (217-profile family tree)
- Status: Well-documented English family line

### 🅱️ Candidate B: John Jeffery of Michigan
- Born: ~1803, England (location unknown)
- Died: 1899, Michigan, USA (age 96)
- Pattern: **Emigrated from England to America**
- Source: FamilySearch "Michigan Deaths and Burials"
- Status: Mentioned in Sarah Jeffery's 1899 death record

### ❓ The Conflict
**Same person cannot die in 1868 Kent AND 1899 Michigan**
**Decision required**: Which candidate matches your research subject?

---

## ☑️ Priority 1: Census Records (DO THIS FIRST)

Access the **full census images** (not just index entries) to get detailed household information.

### [ ] 1841 England Census
- **Access**: FindMyPast (£12.95/month) or Ancestry (£14.99/month)
- **Search**: "John Jeffery" born 1803 ±2 years
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Exact location (enumeration district, village/town, county)
  - ✅ Household members (wife's name, children's names and ages)
  - ✅ Occupation
  - ✅ Birthplace (specific parish if given)
- **Why**: Establishes baseline location in England

**If 1841 census shows John in Brenchley or Tonbridge, Kent** → Supports Candidate A (Kent)
**If 1841 census shows John in a port city (Liverpool, Southampton)** → Possible emigration (Candidate B)
**If 1841 census shows John elsewhere** → May be a third John Jeffery

---

### [ ] 1851 England Census
- **Access**: Same as 1841
- **Search**: Same parameters, but now look for 10-year age progression
- **Extract**: Same fields as 1841
- **Why**: Confirms residence pattern (stayed in Kent vs. disappeared/emigrated)

**If 1851 census shows John in same Kent area with growing family** → Strongly supports Candidate A
**If 1851 census DOESN'T find John in England** → Suggests emigration between 1841-1851 (supports Candidate B)

---

### [ ] 1861 England Census
- **Access**: Same as above
- **Extract**: Same fields
- **Why**: Final confirmation of English residence before proposed 1868 death (Candidate A)

**If 1861 census shows John in Kent** → Candidate A almost certain
**If 1861 census doesn't find John** → Either died 1850s, emigrated, or wrong candidate

---

## ☑️ Priority 2: Marriage Record (1826)

### [ ] Access FamilySearch Marriage Record
- **Source**: FamilySearch "England Marriages, 1538-1973"
- **Search**: John Jeffery married 1826 ±2 years
- **Access**: Free at FamilySearch.org (requires free account)
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Parish name (exact location of marriage)
  - ✅ Bride's full maiden name
  - ✅ John's father's name and occupation
  - ✅ Bride's father's name and occupation
  - ✅ Signatures (literacy indicator)

**Why**: Spouse's name can be cross-checked in census records. Parish location narrows geographic origin.

**If marriage is in Kent and bride's family is also Kent-based** → Supports Candidate A
**If marriage is elsewhere or bride's family has emigration history** → Keeps options open

---

## ☑️ Priority 3: Death Records

**IMPORTANT**: Only pursue death records AFTER census records clarify which candidate to follow.

### [ ] If Pursuing Candidate A (Kent):

#### Order 1868 Tonbridge Death Certificate
- **Source**: UK General Register Office (GRO)
- **Website**: https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/
- **Cost**: £11 (standard certificate)
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (postal delivery)
- **Information Needed to Order**:
  - Name: John Jeffery
  - Death year: 1868 ±1 year
  - District: Tonbridge, Kent
- **Extract from Certificate**:
  - ✅ Exact death date
  - ✅ Age at death (confirms birth year)
  - ✅ Occupation
  - ✅ Cause of death
  - ✅ Informant (often spouse or child - gives family connection)

**Why**: Confirms identity and links to family tree through informant's name.

---

### [ ] If Pursuing Candidate B (Michigan):

#### Order 1899 Michigan Death Certificate
- **Source**: Michigan Department of Health and Human Services OR Ancestry
- **Ancestry Path**: Search "Michigan Death Records" collection
- **State Archive Cost**: ~$15 per certificate
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Full name
  - ✅ Birth date and place (should say "England")
  - ✅ Parents' names (CRITICAL - links to English family)
  - ✅ Spouse's name
  - ✅ Informant (who reported the death)

**Why**: Parents' names will definitively link (or not link) to Edward Jeffery & Lydia Hickmott.

---

#### Access Sarah Jeffery's 1899 Death Record (Michigan)
- **Source**: FamilySearch or Michigan state archives
- **Why**: The original John Jeffery Michigan reference comes from Sarah's death record
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Sarah's full name
  - ✅ Relationship to John Jeffery (wife? daughter? sister?)
  - ✅ Sarah's parents' names
  - ✅ Sarah's birth date and place

**Why**: If Sarah was John's wife, her parents' names and birthplace might match English records. If she was his daughter, her birth year can be cross-checked with English census records for children.

---

## ☑️ Priority 4: FindAGrave Full Memorial

### [ ] Access FindAGrave Memorial 240047451
- **URL**: https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/240047451/john-jeffery
- **Access**: Free (requires FindAGrave account)
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Cemetery name and location
  - ✅ Headstone photograph (if available)
  - ✅ Family members buried nearby
  - ✅ Memorial creator's source notes
  - ✅ Flowers/notes from potential descendants

**Why**: Cemetery location will immediately show if this is the Kent John Jeffery or a different one.

**If cemetery is in Kent (Tonbridge/Brenchley area)** → Likely Candidate A, but death date 1876 conflicts with WikiTree 1868 (needs resolution)
**If cemetery is in Michigan** → Conflicts with 1899 death date (would make this a third John Jeffery)
**If cemetery is elsewhere** → Indicates yet another John Jeffery (NOT the research subject)

---

## ☑️ Priority 5: Michigan Census Search (If Candidate B)

**Only do this if census records 1841-1861 do NOT show John in England, suggesting emigration.**

### [ ] 1850 US Federal Census (Michigan)
- **Access**: FamilySearch (free) or Ancestry
- **Search**: John Jeffery, Michigan, age 47 (born ~1803)
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Exact location (county, township, post office)
  - ✅ Household members (wife, children with ages and birthplaces)
  - ✅ Occupation
  - ✅ Value of real estate (economic status)
  - ✅ Birthplace (should say "England" for John, check children's birthplaces)

**Critical Test**: If children were born in England pre-1840s and in Michigan post-1840s, this proves emigration timing.

---

### [ ] 1860 US Federal Census (Michigan)
- **Extract**: Same fields, check for household continuity
- **Why**: 10-year progression confirms continuous Michigan residence

---

### [ ] 1870 US Federal Census (Michigan)
- **Extract**: Same fields
- **Why**: John would be age 67; seeing him age in consecutive censuses proves continuous residence

---

### [ ] 1880 US Federal Census (Michigan)
- **Extract**: Same fields
- **Why**: John would be age 77; finding him here strongly suggests he survived to 1899 (Candidate B)

**If John appears in ALL FOUR Michigan censuses (1850, 1860, 1870, 1880)** → Candidate B is almost certainly correct
**If John only appears in 1850-1860 then disappears** → May have died earlier (conflicts with 1899 death date)

---

## ☑️ Priority 6: Emigration Records (If Candidate B)

**Only pursue if Michigan censuses confirm John Jeffery in USA.**

### [ ] UK Outbound Passenger Lists
- **Access**: Ancestry "UK and Ireland Outbound Passenger Lists"
- **Search**: John Jeffery, departed 1825-1850, destination USA
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Ship name
  - ✅ Departure port (Liverpool, Southampton, London)
  - ✅ Arrival port (New York, Boston, Philadelphia)
  - ✅ Date of departure
  - ✅ Age at departure
  - ✅ Traveling companions (wife? children?)

**Why**: Confirms emigration event and provides family composition.

---

### [ ] US Naturalization Records (Michigan)
- **Source**: NARA (free) or Ancestry
- **Search**: John Jeffery naturalized in Michigan courts 1835-1875
- **Extract**:
  - ✅ Date of arrival in USA
  - ✅ Port of arrival
  - ✅ Country of origin (should say "England")
  - ✅ Date of naturalization
  - ✅ Witnesses (often family or community members)

**Why**: Naturalization papers often give exact arrival date and port, linking to passenger lists.

## Decision Tree

```
START: Which John Jeffery?
│
├─ Step 1: Check 1841 Census
│   ├─ Found in Kent? → Likely Candidate A (Kent) → Verify with 1851/1861 census
│   ├─ Found in port city? → Possible emigration → Check 1850 US census Michigan
│   └─ Not found? → Check 1850 US census Michigan OR expand search parameters
│
├─ Step 2: Check 1851 Census
│   ├─ Still in Kent? → Almost certainly Candidate A → Order 1868 death certificate
│   ├─ Not found in England? → Likely emigrated 1841-1851 → Check US 1850 census
│   └─ Found elsewhere in England? → May be wrong candidate → Re-evaluate
│
├─ Step 3: Order Death Certificate
│   ├─ If confirmed Kent resident → Order 1868 Tonbridge certificate (£11)
│   ├─ If confirmed Michigan resident → Order 1899 Michigan certificate ($15)
│   └─ If unresolved → DO NOT order yet (wait for more data)
│
└─ Step 4: Resolve or Split Tree
    ├─ If Candidate A confirmed → Remove Michigan record, keep WikiTree tree (217 profiles)
    ├─ If Candidate B confirmed → Remove WikiTree tree, start new Michigan tree
    └─ If neither confirmed → Restart with new seed (more specific parameters)
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Candidate A (Kent) Confirmed ✅
- **Action**: Remove Michigan 1899 death record from tree
- **Action**: Verify WikiTree Jeffery-538 data (correct 1868 vs. 1876 discrepancy)
- **Action**: Retain 217-profile Kent family tree
- **Result**: GPS-compliant English family research

### Scenario 2: Candidate B (Michigan) Confirmed ✅
- **Action**: Remove WikiTree Jeffery-538 tree (wrong person)
- **Action**: Start new Michigan-based tree with US records
- **Action**: Search for emigration and US family records
- **Result**: GPS-compliant American immigrant family research

### Scenario 3: Both Candidates Are Wrong ❌
- **Action**: Mark both as "incorrect matches"
- **Action**: Restart with more specific seed:
  - Add occupation if known
  - Add specific parish if known
  - Add spouse name if known
  - Add known children's names if known
- **Result**: More targeted search with fewer false positives

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Disambiguation successful when**:
1. Census records show clear geographic pattern (stayed in Kent OR emigrated to Michigan)
2. Death certificate confirms parents' names matching (or not matching) WikiTree data
3. All conflicting records are resolved (correct candidate identified, others excluded)
4. Family tree contains only records belonging to ONE John Jeffery
5. GPS Pillars 4 and 5 are met (skillful analysis + coherent conclusion)

---

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Don't assume all "John Jeffery 1803 England" records are the same person**
❌ **Don't ignore conflicting death dates** (1868 vs. 1899 is a 31-year difference!)
❌ **Don't trust WikiTree alone** (user-contributed data can be inaccurate)
❌ **Don't skip census records** (they're the backbone of English genealogy)
❌ **Don't publish unresolved research** (violates GPS standards)

---

## Next Immediate Step

🎯 **Subscribe to FindMyPast (£12.95/month) and access the 1841 England census for John Jeffery born ~1803.**

**Why this first?** Because the 1841 census will immediately tell you:
- If John was in Kent (supports Candidate A)
- If John was in a port city (supports possible emigration)
- If John was elsewhere or not found (suggests wrong candidate or emigration already occurred)

**Timeline**: 1-2 hours (subscription + search + image access)
**Cost**: £12.95
**Payoff**: Immediate direction for the entire research project
