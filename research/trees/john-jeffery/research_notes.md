# John Jeffery Research Case

**Research Started:** 2026-01-26
**Seed Person:** John Jeffery, b. ~1803 England, d. 1899 Michigan

## Research Objective

Establish GPS-compliant proof of identity and life events for John Jeffery who:
- Married in England (1826)
- Appeared in England censuses (1841, 1851, 1861)
- Migrated to Michigan, USA
- Died in Michigan (1899)

## Sources Summary

**Total Records:** 10
**Primary Sources:** 5 (FamilySearch census and vital records)
**Secondary Sources:** 2 (FindAGrave)
**Authored Sources:** 3 (WikiTree profiles)

### Sources Queried
- AccessGenealogy
- FindAGrave
- FamilySearch
- NARA1940
- NARA1950
- USGenWeb
- WikiTree

## Key Findings

### Your FamilySearch Records (Primary Sources)
1. **Marriage 1826** - England Marriages, 1538-1973
2. **Census 1841** - England and Wales
3. **Census 1851** - England and Wales
4. **Census 1861** - England and Wales
5. **Death 1899** - Michigan Deaths and Burials

### Automated Search Results
1. **FindAGrave Memorial 240047451** - John Jeffery 1803-1876
2. **WikiTree Jeffery-538** - John Jeffery, b. 1803 Brenchley Kent, d. 1868 Tonbridge Kent
3. **WikiTree Jefferies-795** - John Jefferies, b. 1803 Norfolk (different spelling/location)

## GPS CONFLICTS REQUIRING RESOLUTION

### Conflict #1: Death Date and Location
- **WikiTree Jeffery-538:** Death 1868 in Tonbridge, Kent, England
- **Your FamilySearch:** Death 1899 in Michigan, USA
- **FindAGrave 240047451:** Death 1876 (location unknown)

**Analysis:** These appear to be THREE DIFFERENT men named John Jeffery born ~1803:
1. One who stayed in Kent, died 1868
2. One who died 1876 (unclear if same as #1)
3. One who emigrated to Michigan, died 1899 (YOUR ancestor)

**Required Action:** Need to obtain:
- Full census transcriptions from 1841/1851/1861 showing residence locations
- Marriage record details (parish, spouse name)
- Michigan death certificate with birth information
- Evidence of migration (passenger lists, naturalization records)

### Conflict #2: Birth Location
- **WikiTree Jeffery-538:** Brenchley, Kent, England
- **WikiTree Jefferies-795:** Forncett St Mary, Norfolk, England
- **Your records:** Unknown (only "England")

**Required Action:** Extract birth location from census enumerations

### Conflict #3: Family Relationships
- **WikiTree Jeffery-538** shows:
  - Father: Edward Jeffery (1765-1849)
  - Mother: Lydia Hickmott (1773-1808)
- **Your records:** No parent information yet

**Required Action:** Examine 1841/1851 censuses for household composition

## Next Steps for GPS Compliance

### Pillar 1: Reasonably Exhaustive Search
- [ ] Obtain full census transcriptions with addresses
- [ ] Search Michigan death records on Ancestry/FamilySearch
- [ ] Search passenger arrival lists 1850-1880
- [ ] Check Michigan naturalization records
- [ ] Search England departure records
- [ ] Check Michigan land/probate records

### Pillar 2: Complete Citations
- [ ] Obtain FamilySearch record URLs/ARK identifiers
- [ ] Document census enumeration details (district, folio, page)
- [ ] Cite marriage parish register properly
- [ ] Obtain Michigan death certificate citation

### Pillar 3: Analysis & Correlation
- [ ] Extract ages from each census to calculate birth year
- [ ] Map geographic locations to confirm same person
- [ ] Identify spouse name from marriage/census records
- [ ] Build household timeline 1841→1861

### Pillar 4: Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Determine which WikiTree profile (if any) matches
- [ ] Explain discrepancies in death dates/locations
- [ ] Document why certain records are excluded

### Pillar 5: Written Conclusion
- [ ] Draft proof argument with evidence chain
- [ ] Cite all sources in Evidence Explained format
- [ ] Submit for GPS critic review

## Geographic Focus

**England (1826-1861+):**
- Marriage location: Unknown parish
- Census locations 1841/1851/1861: Need to extract from records

**Michigan, USA (pre-1899):**
- Death location: Unknown county
- Residence before death: Unknown

**Migration Period:** Between 1861-1899 (need passenger lists)

## Questions to Answer

1. What is the spouse's name? (from marriage record)
2. What specific parish/county in England? (from census)
3. When did they emigrate to Michigan? (passenger lists)
4. Where exactly in Michigan did they settle? (land records, city directories)
5. Are there children who can corroborate identity? (census households)
6. Is there a will or probate file in Michigan? (estate records)

## Source Quality Assessment

| Source Type | Count | Strength | Weakness |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Census | 3 | Primary, contemporary | Details not yet extracted |
| Marriage | 1 | Primary, definitive | No details beyond year/country |
| Death | 1 | Primary, definitive | Limited details (in another person's entry) |
| FindAGrave | 2 | Secondary | Conflicting dates, no documentation |
| WikiTree | 3 | Authored | User-contributed, conflicts with your data |

## Current GPS Assessment

**Pillar 1 (Exhaustive Search):** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - Need detailed census data, Michigan records, migration records
**Pillar 2 (Citations):** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - Missing full FamilySearch citations
**Pillar 3 (Analysis):** ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** - Cannot correlate without census details
**Pillar 4 (Conflicts):** ❌ **UNRESOLVED** - WikiTree death dates conflict
**Pillar 5 (Conclusion):** ❌ **NOT STARTED**

**Overall Status:** Research in progress, not yet GPS-compliant
