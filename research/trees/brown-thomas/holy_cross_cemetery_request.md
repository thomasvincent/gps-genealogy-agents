### Information Requested

I would be grateful for any of the following records, if available:

1. **Interment Records**
   - Exact dates of burial for each individual
   - Plot location (section, row, grave numbers)
   - Confirmation of family plot arrangement

2. **Plot Map or Diagram**

   - Adjacent plots (to identify possible relatives)

3. **Burial Cards or Cemetery Records**
   - Next of kin listed at time of burial

### Research Context

The Brown family were Irish immigrants who arrived in California via New Orleans during the Gold Rush era. Michael Brown and Bridget Joyce were married at St. Patrick's Church, New Orleans, on October 4, 1855, then traveled to Nevada City where Michael worked as a gold miner.

**Family Timeline:**
- 1855: Marriage in New Orleans, Louisiana
- 1857-1875: Eight children born in Nevada City
- c. 1888: Michael's death prompted family's gradual migration
- 1900s-1912: Family dispersed to San Francisco, Fresno, and Santa Rosa
- 1912: Bridget died intestate; probate filed SF Superior Court
- 1944-1951: Final burials (Margaret and Thomas returned from Fresno)

The perpetual care plot at Holy Cross Cemetery (Section H, Row 11) became the family's final gathering place, with six of the eight children returning to be buried with their parents despite living elsewhere.

I am particularly interested in confirming:
- Exact burial dates for Michael Sr. (c. 1888), Michael Jr., and Annie
- Headstone inscriptions for all family members
- Whether Catherine "Kate" Brown Kelly or other siblings are also in this plot
- Plot records showing who purchased the perpetual care arrangement
- Adjacent plots (may reveal other Nevada City Irish families)
