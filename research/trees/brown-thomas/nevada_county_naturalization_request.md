Dear Searle Historical Library Staff,

I am researching my ancestor **Michael Brown**, an Irish immigrant who worked as a gold miner in Nevada City from approximately **1857 to 1888**. I am seeking his naturalization records to confirm his specific place of origin in Ireland and his arrival information in the United States.

### Subject Information

**Name:** Michael Brown
**Birth:** c. 1830, Ireland (county unknown)
**Occupation:** Gold miner
**Residence:** Nevada City, Nevada County, California
  - Boulder Street, Gold Flat area (confirmed by 1870 and 1880 U.S. Census)
**Marriage:** October 4, 1855, New Orleans, Louisiana (to Bridget Joyce)
**Death:** c. 1888, Nevada City, California
**Naturalization (estimated):** 1860s-1880s (required to file mining claims)

### Census Confirmation

**1870 U.S. Census (Nevada City):**
- Michael Brown, age 40, occupation: Gold Miner, birthplace: Ireland
- Household #244, Boulder Street
- Wife Bridget (age 35, Ireland), 6 children (all California-born)

**1880 U.S. Census (Nevada City):**
- Michael Brown, Gold Miner, birthplace: Ireland
- Same household with wife Bridget and children

### Research Request

I understand that your library houses the **"Nevada County naturalization, card index, 1856-1950."** I would be grateful if you could search this index for:

1. **Michael Brown** (naturalization records, 1856-1888)
2. **Mike Brown** (alternate spelling)
3. **M. Brown** (abbreviated entry)

I am particularly interested in:
- Declaration of Intention ("First Papers")
- Petition for Naturalization ("Second Papers")
- Any documents stating his specific **county or parish of origin in Ireland**
- Port of entry and date of arrival in the United States

### Why This Research Matters

Michael's naturalization papers would be the critical document that confirms:
- His specific origin in Ireland (enabling Irish parish research)
- His arrival date and port of entry (likely New Orleans)
- His residency timeline in California
- His eligibility to file mining claims in Nevada County

Without this information, I cannot trace his family back to Ireland to connect with cousins who still reside there.

## What to Expect from the Search

### Possible Outcomes

**Best Case Scenario:**
- Declaration of Intention found with specific Irish county/parish
- Petition for Naturalization with arrival date and port
- Court order granting citizenship
- **Result**: Direct path to Irish parish research

**Moderate Success:**
- Card index entry found with file number
- Must request full court file separately
- May take additional time and fees
- **Result**: Leads to complete naturalization documents

**Challenging Scenario:**
- Multiple "Michael Brown" entries found
- Need to cross-reference with known details (wife's name, residence, occupation)
- May require on-site research to compare handwriting/details
- **Result**: Requires careful verification

**Not Found Scenario:**
- No naturalization record located
- Possible reasons:
  1. Michael never formally naturalized (worked under Irish status)
  2. Records lost in courthouse fire or deterioration
  3. Filed under variant name spelling
  4. Filed in different county (San Francisco? Placer County?)
- **Alternative approaches**:
  - Search San Francisco naturalization records (if he naturalized before coming to Nevada City)

  - Search voter registration records (required citizenship)
