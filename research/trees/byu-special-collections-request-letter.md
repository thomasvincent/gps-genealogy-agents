**RE: Genealogical Research Request - Karl G. Maeser Memorial Building Construction Records (1909-1911)**

Dear Special Collections Staff,

I am conducting genealogical research on my ancestor, **James Eli Tregeagle** (1863-1934), who served as the lead stonemason and masonry contractor for the **Karl G. Maeser Memorial Building** at BYU during its construction from 1909-1911.

James Eli operated the **Belmont Stone Company** in Provo and was responsible for the exterior stonework on the Maeser Building, including the hand-carved Ionic columns, dentil molding, and Sanpete White Oolitic Limestone ashlar walls. The building is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP #71000854).

I am seeking any archival materials that may document his work, including but not limited to:

### Primary Documents Requested

**1. Construction Records (1909-1911)**
- Building Committee meeting minutes or progress reports
- Contractor payment records or payroll logs mentioning "James Eli Tregeagle," "J.E. Tregeagle," "Belmont Stone Company," or "Tregeagle & Co."
- Correspondence between the university and masonry contractors
- Invoices or billing records for stonework materials or labor

**2. Architectural Documentation**
- Original blueprints or construction drawings by Ware & Treganza (the architectural firm)
- Any notations on plans specifying the stone contractor
- Specification documents listing materials and craftsmen
- Technical reports on the Sanpete limestone quarrying or selection

**3. Photographic Collections**
- Construction photographs from 1909-1911 showing stonework in progress
- Images of workers or craftsmen at the building site
- Any photos labeled with contractor names
- Dedication day photographs (October 9, 1911) that may include builders

**4. University Administrative Records**
- Trustee meeting minutes discussing the Maeser Building project
- Presidential correspondence regarding construction contracts
- Annual reports mentioning building progress or contractors

**5. Published or Archival Histories**
- BYU campus history collections referencing the Maeser Building
- Oral histories from Provo community members mentioning the Tregeagle family
- Historical society materials donated to BYU collections

### Specific Questions I Hope to Answer

1. **Contract Documentation**: Is there a formal contract or bid proposal from the Belmont Stone Company for the Maeser Building stonework?

2. **Payment Records**: Are there records showing the total amount paid to James Eli Tregeagle/Belmont Stone Company for the project?

3. **Construction Timeline**: Do records specify when the stonework began and ended, and whether there were any delays or complications?

4. **Material Sourcing**: Is there documentation of the limestone quarrying near Manti/Ephraim, Utah, and the transport to Provo?

5. **Craftsmen**: Did James Eli employ a crew for this project, and if so, are any workers' names recorded?

6. **Building Specifications**: Were there specific technical requirements for the stonework that would demonstrate the level of skill required?

7. **Quality Inspections**: Are there any contemporary assessments or reports on the quality of the stonework?

8. **Photographic Evidence**: Are there any construction-phase photographs showing James Eli Tregeagle or his workers on site?

### Format Preferences

If records are located, I would appreciate:
- **Digital scans** (PDF or JPG) of documents/photographs (I can provide funding for scanning fees if necessary)
- **Photocopies** if scanning is not available
- **Transcriptions** of any handwritten documents that may be difficult to read
- **Citation information** (collection name, box/folder numbers, etc.) for proper documentation in my research

I am willing to:
- Visit the reading room in person if necessary (please advise on appointment procedures)
- Pay reasonable research and reproduction fees
- Provide additional information about the Tregeagle family if helpful for your search

### Family Context

James Eli Tregeagle was the brother-in-law of **Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent**, an Episcopal priest who founded St. Peter's Church in Salt Lake City in 1896. The two men represent complementary aspects of the American West's development—one building physical monuments, the other building spiritual communities.

James Eli's work on the Maeser Building is the most significant surviving example of his craftsmanship and represents the pinnacle of early 20th-century institutional architecture in Utah. This research will be included in a comprehensive family history documenting the immigrant experience of English, Irish, and Channel Islander families who helped build the American West.

### Acknowledgment

I understand that:
- Your staff may need several weeks to search the collections
- Not all requested records may exist or be accessible
- There may be fees associated with research time and photocopying/scanning
- I will properly cite BYU Special Collections in any publications or presentations

Please let me know:
1. Whether these materials are likely to be in your collections
2. The estimated timeline for a records search
3. Any fees associated with research and reproduction
4. Whether an in-person visit would be more effective than a mail/email request

I deeply appreciate your assistance with this genealogical research project. The Maeser Building stands as a testament to my ancestor's craftsmanship, and any documentation you can provide will be treasured by our family.

Thank you for your time and expertise.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]

### If Initial Search Is Unsuccessful

Consider requesting searches in:
1. **BYU Physical Facilities Department**: May have maintenance records or original architectural drawings
2. **Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints History Library**: LDS Church involvement in early BYU buildings
