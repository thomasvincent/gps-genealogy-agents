## Ancestral Origins: Two Migration Waves

### The Direct Line (19th Century "New Wave")

#### Frederick Janvrin Vincent
- **Born:** 1850, Yorkshire, England
- **First emigration:** Early 1870s to Christchurch, New Zealand
- **Marriage:** c. 1875, New Zealand, to Laura Alice Tregeagle
- **U.S. arrival:** 1881, San Francisco (from Auckland)
- **Pattern:** England → New Zealand → USA

#### Frederick Augustus Vincent (Father)
- **Born:** c. 1827, England
- **U.S. arrival:** c. 1885, Massachusetts
- **Significance:** Provided "home base" when Frederick brought family from New Zealand
- **Connection:** Why Frederick could take NY missionary role (1887) - family network in Northeast

### The Maternal Line (Colonial "Old Wave")

#### Janvrin Family (Channel Islands Origin)

**Earliest Ancestor:** Jean "John" Janvrin
**Origin:** Jersey, Channel Islands
**U.S. Arrival:** c. 1700
**Settlement:** Portsmouth, New Hampshire

**Jean "John" Janvrin:**
- Born: 1707, Portsmouth, New Hampshire
- First documented Janvrin in New England records
- Background: Seafaring family from Jersey (Channel Islands)
- Legacy: By 1840, 67% of all Janvrins in U.S. lived in Massachusetts

**Significance of "Janvrin" Name:**
- Legendary sea captains and merchants from Jersey
- Established "cousin networks" in New York and New England by 1880s
- Opened doors for Frederick in NY Diocese missionary work (1887)
- Middle name carried significant social capital in Northeast

## Migration Summary: Three Generations, Three Continents

| Ancestor | Origin | First U.S. Arrival | Primary Settlement |
|----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Jean Janvrin | Jersey, Channel Islands | c. 1700 | Portsmouth, NH |
| Frederick Augustus Vincent | Yorkshire, England | c. 1885 | Massachusetts |
| Frederick Janvrin Vincent | Yorkshire (via NZ) | 1881 | San Francisco (via WA, NY, TX, UT) |

---

## Why the "Two-Year Pattern" Made Sense

Frederick Janvrin Vincent's constant movement was ancestral:
1. **Janvrin seafarers:** Channel Islands → Portsmouth, NH (c. 1700)
2. **Vincent migration:** England → New Zealand (1870s)
3. **Frederick's journey:** New Zealand → USA (1881)
4. **American frontier:** Washington → NY → Texas → Utah → California (1881-1899)

**Result:** By the time he settled in San Francisco (1899), he had:
- Crossed three oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Tasman Sea)
- Lived on three continents (Europe, Oceania, North America)
- Founded churches in nearly every U.S. time zone
- Established presence from Washington Territory to New York State

**Family trait:** No single generation stayed in one place. Founding was in their nature.
