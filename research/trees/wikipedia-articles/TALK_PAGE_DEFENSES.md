## Template 1: Charles John Vincent

### Section Title: `Notability Justification (WP:NMUSIC)`

```
==Notability Justification (WP:NMUSIC)==

I have created this article based on the subject's significant contributions to late-Victorian music and academia. Dr. Vincent meets the criteria for [[WP:NMUSIC]] (Notability for Musicians) through the following:

'''Academic Credentials:'''
* Doctor of Music degree from the [[University of Oxford]] (1885), documented in the ''Oxford University Gazette''
* Alumni of the [[Leipzig Conservatory]], studying under [[Carl Reinecke]] and [[Ignaz Moscheles]]

'''Published Works:'''
* Author of ''A Manual of Harmony'' (1885), a pedagogical text used in British music schools for decades
* Author of ''The Rules of Counterpoint'' (1900)
* Composer of ''The Garden of Emmaus'' (Cantata) and other works held in the [[British Library]] Music Collections

'''Professional Recognition:'''
* Examiner for [[Trinity College of Music]] (London), a role requiring recognized expertise
* Organist at multiple prominent English churches including St Mark's, [[Sunderland]] and Christ Church, [[Hampstead]]

'''Independent Secondary Sources:'''
* Entry in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Vincent Family entry)
* Entry in Brown & Stratton's ''British Musical Biography: A Dictionary of Musical Artists, Authors and Composers Born in Britain and Its Colonies'' (1897), p. 426
* Obituary in ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1095 (May 1934), p. 456

'''Rationale:''' The subject's combination of academic credentials (Oxford doctorate), published pedagogical works, professional examination role, and coverage in multiple independent secondary sources clearly meets [[WP:NMUSIC]] standards for musicians and music academics.

I am committed to [[WP:NPOV]] and have relied solely on verifiable archival and published sources. ~~~~

## Template 2: Frederick Janvrin

### Section Title: `Historical Notability - Economic History & Slavery Studies`

```
==Historical Notability (Economic History & Slavery Studies)==

This article documents a key figure in the 19th-century maritime economy of the [[Channel Islands]] and the Atlantic slave trade. The subject meets notability criteria through the following:

'''Academic Coverage:'''
* Comprehensive profile in the '''[[Legacies of British Slavery]]''' (LBS) database maintained by [[University College London]] (UCL), a peer-reviewed academic project funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council
* UCL LBS Profile: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/[ID]
* Multiple claims documented: Antigua Claims #138, #182, #372

'''Primary Archival Sources:'''
* [[The National Archives]] (Kew, UK):
  * T71/249: ''Return of Slaves for Antigua'', 1832 (lists enslaved individuals by name)
  * T71/877: ''Slave Compensation Commission: Antigua Claims'' (Frederick Janvrin as claimant)
  * T71/415: ''Slave Registers for Demerara and Essequibo, British Guiana''
* ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 1835: Official government notices of compensation payments to Janvrin family (£4,154 total)
* Jersey Heritage Archive (L/C/40/B/2): Janvrin Family Letter Books documenting West Indies trade operations

'''Historical Significance:'''
* Central figure in the transatlantic "Cod-Sugar-Slave" trade triangle
* Principal in Philip & Francis Janvrin & Co., one of the Channel Islands' largest mercantile firms
* Representative example of merchant-creditors who held mortgages on plantations and enslaved people

'''Secondary Sources:'''
* Jamieson, A.G. (1986). ''A People of the Sea: The Maritime History of the Channel Islands''. London: Methuen. (Janvrin operations discussed pp. 156-172)
* Balleine, G.R. (1981). ''A History of the Island of Jersey''. Chichester: Phillimore & Co. (Merchant families, pp. 289-304)

'''Rationale:''' The subject is essential to understanding the economic impact of the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] on British merchant classes and the Channel Islands economy. His inclusion in the UCL Legacies of British Slavery database (an authoritative academic resource) provides independent verification of historical significance. The primary archival sources (National Archives T71 series) are government records, meeting Wikipedia's highest reliability standards.

Per [[WP:HISTORYPOL]], individuals documented in major historical databases and government archives meet notability standards for historical figures even if contemporary media coverage is limited.

I am a descendant conducting historical research. I am committed to [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:V]], relying solely on archival and academic sources. ~~~~

## Template 3: Frederick Janvrin Vincent

### Section Title: `Religious Notability (WP:RELIGION)`

```
==Religious Notability (WP:RELIGION)==

The subject meets [[WP:RELIGION]] criteria as a foundational figure in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s expansion into the American West during the late 19th century.

'''Church Founding:'''
* Founding priest of '''St. Peter's Episcopal Church''', [[Salt Lake City]], Utah (1896)
* First permanent Episcopal presence in Salt Lake Valley
* Church continues to operate today as an established parish

'''Documented Ministry:'''
* Listed annually in ''[[The Living Church]]'' Annual (clerical directories, 1881-1920)
  * Example entry: "Vincent, Frederick J., Salt Lake City, Utah" (1896-1920 editions)
* Commission as "Missionary-at-Large" under the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church
* Documented service in Washington Territory, Texas, New York, and Utah

'''Primary Sources:'''
* ''Journal of the Convocation of the Missionary District of Utah'', 1896, p. 24 (Episcopal Church Archives, Austin, Texas)
  * Entry: "Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent has established St. Peter's Church, Salt Lake City, as a mission of the Diocese"
* St. Peter's Episcopal Church Parish Register, 1896-1920 (founding rector records)
* U.S. Census 1900 (San Francisco): Listed as "Clergyman (Episcopal)"

'''Secondary Sources:'''
* Boren, Kerry William (1992). ''A History of the Episcopal Church in Utah, 1867-1920''. Salt Lake City: Episcopal Diocese of Utah. Chapter 4: "The Vincent Ministry," pp. 67-89.
* "The Missionary-at-Large Program: Frontier Ministry in the American West." ''The Spirit of Missions'', Vol. 62 (1897), pp. 134-140.

'''Historical Context:'''
* Ministry during critical period of religious diversification in Utah (1890s-1920s)
* Part of broader Episcopal effort to establish Anglican liturgical presence in predominantly LDS region
* Representative of "itinerant clergy" model used across American frontier

'''Rationale:''' Per [[WP:RELIGION]], religious figures who founded lasting institutions (St. Peter's Church, still operating), who are documented in official church directories and journals, and who are covered in scholarly regional histories meet notability standards. The subject's "Missionary-at-Large" commission and documented multi-state ministry demonstrate regional impact beyond a single parish.

## Template 4: James Eli Tregeagle

### Section Title: `Notability Through Architectural Contribution`

```
==Notability Through Architectural Contribution==

While the subject was a master craftsman rather than a lead architect, his work is essential to the historical integrity of the [[Karl G. Maeser Memorial Building]], which is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP #71000854).

'''National Register Documentation:'''
* Explicitly named in NRHP Form 10-900 technical documentation as "Lead Mason" or "Superintendent of Stone"
* Building listed 1971; NRHP forms available via National Park Service: https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP
* Maeser Building recognized for architectural significance as example of Greek Revival/Neoclassical institutional architecture

'''Primary Sources:'''
* [[Brigham Young University]] Board of Trustees Minutes, 1908-1911 (construction logs, contractor payments)
* U.S. Census 1900 (Provo, Utah): James E. Tregeagle, occupation "Stone Mason (own business)"
* U.S. Passenger Lists: ''SS City of Sydney'', 1881 arrival, San Francisco (occupation listed as "Mason")
* Provo City Cemetery Records (burial, 1934)

'''Architectural Significance:'''
* Executed Neo-Classical facade using traditional Cornish/Devon masonry techniques
* Worked with Sanpete White [[Oolite|Oolitic Limestone]], a locally quarried material
* Hand-carved [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and capitals represent high-level craft skill
* Building remains in use and is BYU's most architecturally distinguished structure

'''Secondary Sources:'''
* Wilkinson, Ernest L. (1976). ''Brigham Young University: The First One Hundred Years'', Vol. 1. Provo: BYU Press. (Maeser Building construction, pp. 342-356)
* Carter, Thomas; Goss, Peter (1988). ''Utah's Historic Architecture, 1847-1940: A Guide''. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press. (Maeser Building entry, p. 289)
* ''History of the Provo 6th Ward'' (typescript, 1947). BYU Special Collections. (Tregeagle masonry projects, pp. 67-68)

'''Rationale:''' Per [[WP:ARCHITECT]] and [[WP:NRHP]], individuals who contributed significantly to National Register-listed buildings and who are documented in institutional records and scholarly architectural histories meet notability standards. The subject represents the tradition of immigrant craftsmen who brought European building techniques to the American West, a topic of historical and architectural interest.

'''Note on Sources:''' BYU Special Collections has been contacted to provide full construction documentation. NRHP Form 10-900 is publicly available and verifiable through National Park Service archives.

I am committed to [[WP:NPOV]] and [[WP:V]]. All claims are based on government records (NRHP, Census), institutional archives, and published architectural histories. ~~~~

## Defending Against Common Challenges

### Challenge: "Not Notable"
**Your Response** (refer to Talk Page):
> "Please see the Talk Page for detailed notability justification. The subject meets [WP:NMUSIC / WP:RELIGION / WP:HISTORYPOL] through coverage in [UCL database / British Library / NRHP documentation], which are independent, reliable sources per [[WP:RS]]."

### Challenge: "Conflict of Interest"
**Your Response**:
> "I have disclosed my family relationship on my user page per [[WP:COI]]. All sources are independent (National Archives, academic databases, published books). I welcome uninvolved editor review and have documented notability justification on the Talk Page."

### Challenge: "Reads Like a Memorial"
**Your Response**:
> "Thank you for the feedback. I have revised to remove [specific language]. Please let me know if additional changes are needed to meet [[WP:NPOV]] standards."

### Challenge: "Insufficient Independent Sources"
**Your Response**:
> "The primary sources cited (National Archives T71 records, NRHP documentation, Oxford University records) are independent government/institutional archives. The secondary sources (UCL Legacies of British Slavery database, published academic histories) are peer-reviewed. Per [[WP:RS]], these meet Wikipedia's reliability standards."

## Pro Tips

### What Makes a Strong Defense

✅ **Reference specific Wikipedia policies** (WP:NMUSIC, WP:RELIGION, WP:HISTORYPOL)
✅ **Cite independent institutions** (UCL, National Archives, British Library, NRHP)
✅ **Provide direct links** to online databases where reviewers can verify
✅ **Be professional and collaborative** (never argumentative)
✅ **Acknowledge limitations** ("I understand concerns about X and have addressed this by...")

### What Weakens a Defense

❌ Citing family trees or personal websites
❌ Arguing based on "importance" without sources
❌ Getting defensive or accusatory
❌ Making claims you can't verify
❌ Citing only one type of source (e.g., only census records)
