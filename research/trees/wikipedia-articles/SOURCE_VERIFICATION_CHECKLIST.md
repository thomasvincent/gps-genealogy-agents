## 🚨 Red Flags: When NOT to Submit

**DO NOT submit an article if**:

❌ The primary source does NOT exist or is misreferenced
❌ The subject's name does NOT appear in the claimed source
❌ You cannot verify the core claim (e.g., St. Peter's founding, Maeser Building work)
❌ All sources are family trees or self-published materials

**In these cases**: Either find additional sources OR wait until archival research provides confirmation.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: Wikipedia Verification

When Wikipedia reviewers check your sources, they will:
1. Click on the links you provide (UCL LBS, National Archives)
2. Search for the subject's name in those databases
3. Verify that the source supports the claim

**Your advantage**: You've already done this verification before submission, so you know the sources work.

**Your disadvantage**: If a reviewer cannot easily verify a source (e.g., Jersey Heritage archive code), they may request additional proof or tag the statement.

**Solution**: For any non-online source, add a note in the citation:
```
<ref>Jersey Heritage Archive, L/C/40/B/2. Available by appointment; contact archives@jerseyheritage.org.</ref>
```

This shows the reviewer how they could verify the source if needed.

---

**Next Step**: Work through the "Immediate Actions" checklist above, then update your verification status template.

**Goal**: Have all checkboxes completed before submitting articles to Wikipedia.

**Timeline**: 1-2 hours for free online verification, 2-6 weeks if waiting for archival responses.
