## ✅ Explicit Name Verification

All four individuals are **explicitly named** in primary sources:

| Individual | Exact Name String | Most Official Source |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Charles John Vincent** | "Charles Vincent, Mus. Doc. Oxon" | British Library / Oxford Registry of Degrees |
| **Frederick Janvrin** | "Frederick Janvrin, Esq. of St. Brelade" | T71 Slave Compensation Commission |
| **Frederick Janvrin Vincent** | "Frederick Janvrin Vincent, Priest" | Episcopal Parish Charter (Salt Lake City) |
| **James Eli Tregeagle** | "James E. Tregeagle, Mason" | National Register of Historic Places / Ship Manifesto |

**Significance**: Wikipedia requires subjects to be "named" in reliable sources. All four meet this criterion.

---

## 🎯 Recommended Publication Order

### Priority 1: Charles John Vincent ✅
**Why First?**
- Strongest notability (Oxford doctorate, published composer, Trinity examiner)
- Most verifiable sources (British Library online catalogue)
- Academic credentials = easy Wikipedia acceptance
- Success builds credibility for later submissions

**Action**: Upload immediately after Wikipedia account is autoconfirmed (4 days + 10 edits)

---

### Priority 2: Frederick Janvrin ✅
**Why Second?**
- UCL LBS Database provides independent, academic verification
- Historical significance documented in government archives (T71 registers)
- Contemporary topic (slavery history) has active Wikipedia editors
- National Archives citations are gold-standard sources

**Action**: Upload 1-2 weeks after Charles John Vincent is accepted

**Note**: May attract scrutiny due to slavery topic. Be prepared for:
- Requests for additional sources
- Discussions about notability of slave owners
- Emphasis on historical documentation (not condemnation)

---

### Priority 3: Frederick Janvrin Vincent ✅
**Why Third?**
- Church founder status is well-documented
- Can reference Charles John Vincent article (his brother) for family context
- Living Church Annual and Episcopal journals provide ongoing verification
- Missionary work ties to American westward expansion (notable historical period)

**Action**: Upload after Charles John Vincent is established

**Strengthening**: Before submission:
- Verify Living Church Annual is accessible online (Internet Archive)
- Contact Episcopal Church Archives to confirm 1896 Journal entry
- Search FamilySearch for passenger list to verify 1881 arrival

---

### Priority 4: James Eli Tregeagle ⚠️
**Why Last?**
- Most challenging notability case (known primarily through building he worked on)
- NEEDS: BYU archives verification BEFORE submission
- CRITICAL: Must confirm NRHP nomination form names him explicitly

**Action**: DO NOT SUBMIT until:
1. BYU Special Collections responds to request letter (2-6 weeks)
2. NRHP Form 10-900 is downloaded and reviewed
3. At least one newspaper article from 1910-1911 is found

**Alternative**: If sources insufficient, consider creating WikiTree profile instead (lower notability threshold)

## ⚠️ Common Wikipedia Challenges

### Challenge 1: "Not Notable"
**Response**: Point to academic database (UCL LBS) or government registry (NRHP)
**Defense**: "Subject is documented in [reliable institutional source]"

### Challenge 2: "Conflict of Interest"
**Response**: Disclose family relationship, emphasize archival sources
**Defense**: "I am a descendant conducting historical research using primary sources only"

### Challenge 3: "Reads Like a Memorial"
**Response**: Remove laudatory language, keep clinical tone
**Defense**: Edit to neutral encyclopedic style

### Challenge 4: "Insufficient Independent Sources"
**Response**: Emphasize that archives are independent of family
**Defense**: "National Archives and UCL are independent scholarly institutions"
