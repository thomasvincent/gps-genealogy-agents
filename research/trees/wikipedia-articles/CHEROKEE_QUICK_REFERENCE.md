## Most Common Wikipedia Reviewer Question

**Q**: "How do you prove the Hair Conrad connection?"

**A**: "Dawes Roll #6187 (Robert McLemore, Card #2619) contains testimony naming George Washington Scraper as father. Dawes Roll #15931 (George W. Scraper, Card #6763) lists parents as Di-su-go-s-gi and Tiana Smith. Emmet Starr's *History of the Cherokee Indians* (1921, pp. 112-115, 268) documents the Scraper family as Hair Conrad descendants. Hair Conrad himself is documented in NARA RG 75 Entry 269 (Trail of Tears muster rolls) and the 1827 Cherokee Constitution (Oklahoma Historical Society)."
