# Wikipedia Internal Linking Strategy
## Connecting Articles to Create a Web of Notability

**Purpose**: Create internal links between articles to prevent orphaning and establish narrative coherence
**Created**: 2026-01-27
**Strategy**: Link articles to each other AND to high-traffic existing Wikipedia pages

---

## Why Internal Linking Matters

### The Orphan Problem
- Wikipedia articles with NO incoming links are called "orphans"
- Orphaned articles are prime targets for deletion
- Reviewers see orphans as potentially non-notable

### The Web of Notability
- Linking articles together shows they're part of a larger historical narrative
- Connections to existing high-traffic pages integrate your articles into Wikipedia's structure
- Cross-references demonstrate multiple verification paths

## Part 1: Linking the Four Family Articles

### Frederick Janvrin Article

**Add to "Family and legacy" section** (create this section if it doesn't exist):

```wiki
==Family and legacy==
The Janvrin maritime legacy continued through the 19th century, influencing the careers of several descendants in the United States and the United Kingdom. His great-niece, Amelia Janvrin (1829–1904), married Frederick Augustus Vincent, a music professor. Their sons included [[Charles John Vincent]], who became a prominent composer and [[Doctor of Music|Mus.Doc]] from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] missionary who founded churches across the American West.

The family's Channel Islands merchant wealth, derived in part from Atlantic trade including slavery-connected commerce, provided the financial foundation for the next generation's education and professional opportunities. This pattern of wealth transfer is documented in the [[Legacies of British Slavery]] database maintained by [[University College London]].
```

### Charles John Vincent Article

**Add to "Early life and education" section**:

```wiki
Vincent was born in 1852 in [[Batley]], [[Yorkshire]], the eldest son of Frederick Augustus Vincent, a professor of music, and Amelia Janvrin. Through his mother, he was connected to the prominent Janvrin merchant family of [[Jersey]], Channel Islands. His great-granduncle, [[Frederick Janvrin]], was a major shipowner and merchant in the transatlantic trade during the early 19th century.

Charles John's brother, [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]], became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] missionary and founded [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Salt Lake City)|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. The family's financial resources, derived from the Channel Islands maritime economy, enabled both brothers to pursue professional education and international careers.
```

**Add to "Personal life" section** (create if needed):

```wiki
==Personal life==
Vincent was part of the musically prominent Vincent family. His brother, [[George Frederick Vincent]], was also a noted organist and composer. Another brother, [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]], served as an Episcopal missionary in the American West, representing the family's diverse professional achievements across music and ministry.

Vincent married [wife's name if known] and had [children if known]. He died in 1934 in [[Hampstead]], London, where he had served as organist at Christ Church.
```

### Frederick Janvrin Vincent Article

**Add to "Early life and education" section**:

```wiki
Vincent was born in 1850 in [[Batley]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of Frederick Augustus Vincent, a professor of music, and Amelia Janvrin. He was named after his great-granduncle, [[Frederick Janvrin]], a prominent Jersey merchant and shipowner who was involved in the transatlantic trade during the early 19th century.

His brother, [[Charles John Vincent]], became a distinguished composer and [[Doctor of Music]] from [[University of Oxford]]. The Vincent family's professional achievements spanned music, ministry, and education, reflecting the opportunities afforded by their Channel Islands merchant heritage.
```

**Add to "Personal life" section**:

```wiki
==Personal life==
Vincent married Laura Alice Tregeagle (1863–1953), daughter of [[James Eli Tregeagle]], a master stonemason from [[Cornwall]]. The Tregeagle family had emigrated from [[England]] to the [[United States]] in 1881, settling initially in [[San Francisco]] before moving to [[Utah Territory]].

The Vincents had children, including Paul Janvrin Vincent, who remained in California. Vincent maintained connections with his English family, including his brother [[Charles John Vincent]] in [[Hampstead]], London. He died in 1920 in [[Salt Lake City]] and is buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Salt Lake City)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]].
```

### James Eli Tregeagle Article

**Add to "Personal life" section**:

```wiki
==Personal life==
Tregeagle married Jane Roberts, and the couple had several children. Their daughter, Laura Alice Tregeagle (1863–1953), married [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] missionary who founded [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Salt Lake City)|St. Peter's Episcopal Church]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. This marriage connected the Tregeagle family's Cornish masonry tradition to the Vincent family's English musical and ecclesiastical heritage.

The family maintained connections to both the Channel Islands immigrant community (through the Vincent marriage) and Utah's growing professional class. Tregeagle died on 16 November 1934 in Salt Lake City and is buried at [[Provo City Cemetery]].

## Part 2: Linking to High-Traffic Existing Pages

### Strategic Links to Add

#### Frederick Janvrin Article
```wiki
His firm operated within the broader context of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the [[Triangular trade]] system connecting Europe, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Americas. The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] fundamentally altered the economic model of British merchant families operating in the West Indies. Janvrin's compensation claims are documented in the [[Legacies of British Slavery]] database, a major research project by [[University College London]] examining British involvement in slavery.

The [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] merchant economy was deeply integrated into [[British Empire]] trade networks, particularly the [[cod trade]] from [[Newfoundland]] to the Caribbean, where salt cod fed enslaved plantation workers.
```

#### Charles John Vincent Article
```wiki
Vincent's education at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]] placed him in the tradition of [[Romantic music|Romantic]] composers who studied under masters like [[Carl Reinecke]] and [[Ignaz Moscheles]]. His [[Doctor of Music]] degree from [[University of Oxford]] (1885) aligned with the Victorian era's professionalization of music education.

As an examiner for [[Trinity College London|Trinity College of Music]], Vincent contributed to the standardization of music education across the [[British Empire]]. His works are held in the [[British Library]]'s Music Collections, ensuring their preservation for musicological research.
```

#### Frederick Janvrin Vincent Article
```wiki
Vincent's work was part of the broader [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]'s domestic mission program, which sought to establish [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]] liturgical presence in the expanding American West. His "Missionary-at-Large" commission aligned with the [[Manifest Destiny]] era's religious expansion.

In [[Salt Lake City]], Vincent's Episcopal mission provided an alternative to the dominant [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] religious culture, contributing to the [[religious diversity]] of [[Utah Territory]] and later the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Utah]]. His ministry followed the pattern of [[circuit rider (religious)|circuit rider]] clergy who established missions in multiple frontier communities.
```

#### James Eli Tregeagle Article
```wiki
The [[Karl G. Maeser Memorial Building]], designed by [[Ware & Treganza]], exemplifies [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] and [[Neoclassical architecture]] in institutional settings. Tregeagle's work with [[Oolite|Sanpete White Oolitic Limestone]] demonstrated traditional [[stonemasonry]] techniques adapted to locally available materials.

The building's listing on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP #71000854) recognizes both its architectural significance and its role in [[Brigham Young University]]'s history. Tregeagle represents the tradition of [[Cornwall|Cornish]] and [[Devon]] immigrant craftsmen who brought European building techniques to the [[Western United States]].

## Implementation Checklist

### Before Submitting Articles

- [ ] Add family connection text to each article
- [ ] Add links to high-traffic Wikipedia pages
- [ ] Add appropriate categories (at bottom of article)
- [ ] Add "See also" sections (before References)
- [ ] Verify all [[double-bracketed]] links are to actual Wikipedia articles
- [ ] Check that internal family links work (may need to create redirect pages)

### After Articles Are Published

- [ ] Go to linked high-traffic pages and add back-links if appropriate
- [ ] Create redirect pages if needed (e.g., "Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent" → "Frederick Janvrin Vincent")
- [ ] Monitor "What links here" to see if other editors are linking to your articles
- [ ] Add articles to relevant WikiProjects (WikiProject Biography, WikiProject Christianity, etc.)

---

## Advanced: Creating a Family Template (Optional)

**Only do this AFTER all four articles are accepted and stable** (3-6 months post-publication).

### Template:Janvrin-Vincent family

```wiki
{{Navbox
| name = Janvrin-Vincent family
| title = [[Frederick Janvrin|Janvrin]]-[[Frederick Janvrin Vincent|Vincent]]-[[James Eli Tregeagle|Tregeagle]] family
| state = {{{state|autocollapse}}}
| listclass = hlist

| group1 = Channel Islands merchants
| list1 =
* [[Frederick Janvrin]] (c. 1780–1860)
* Philip Janvrin
* Francis Janvrin

| group2 = Music and academia
| list2 =
* [[Charles John Vincent]] (1852–1934)
* [[George Frederick Vincent]]
* Frederick Augustus Vincent

| group3 = Clergy and mission
| list3 =
* [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]] (1850–1920)
* [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Salt Lake City)]]

| group4 = Architecture and craft
| list4 =
* [[James Eli Tregeagle]] (1863–1934)
* [[Karl G. Maeser Memorial Building]]
}}
```

**Note**: Only create this template if you're an established Wikipedia editor. New users creating family templates often get accused of "dynasty building."

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Over-Link
❌ **Bad**: "He was born in [[Batley]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]] on [[18 October]] [[1863]]"
✅ **Good**: "He was born in [[Batley]], [[Yorkshire]], England on 18 October 1863"

**Rule**: Only link the first mention of a place/concept in each article. Don't link common years or dates.

### Don't Create Circular Links
❌ **Bad**: Frederick Janvrin article says "See [[Frederick Janvrin Vincent]]" and Frederick Janvrin Vincent article says "See [[Frederick Janvrin]]" with no context

✅ **Good**: Each article naturally mentions the family member in context with biographical details

### Don't Link to Non-Existent Articles
- Before publishing, verify all [[bracketed]] links go to real Wikipedia pages
- Use the search bar to confirm the page exists
- If it doesn't exist, either remove the brackets or create a redirect

---

## Timeline for Implementation

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | Add internal family links to draft articles | Before submission |
| **Phase 2** | Add high-traffic page links to draft articles | Before submission |
| **Phase 3** | Add categories and "See also" sections | Before submission |
| **Phase 4** | Submit articles via Articles for Creation | Weeks 1-8 |
| **Phase 5** | After acceptance, monitor "What links here" | Weeks 9-12 |
| **Phase 6** | Add to relevant WikiProjects | Weeks 13-16 |
| **Phase 7** | Consider family template (OPTIONAL) | 6+ months post-publication |

---

## Expected Outcome

Once all linking is complete, each article will:
- ✅ Be linked to 3-4 other family articles (not orphaned)
- ✅ Be linked to 5-10 high-traffic Wikipedia pages (integrated into site structure)
- ✅ Be categorized in 5-10 relevant categories (discoverable via search)
- ✅ Have "See also" links showing broader context
- ✅ Appear in "What links here" for major Wikipedia pages (backlinks)

**Result**: Articles are much harder to delete because they're integrated into Wikipedia's web of information.
