## Key Transitions in Family History

### Transition 1: Artisan Class Establishment (1680-1750)
**From**: Agricultural workers / general laborers
**To**: Skilled craftsmen with documented apprenticeships
**Evidence**: Parish registers show shift from generic "laborer" to specific "mason" designations

### Transition 2: Guild Master Status (1750-1850)
**From**: Journeymen masons
**To**: Master craftsmen authorized to train apprentices
**Evidence**: 1776 Apprenticeship Indentures showing "Master of the Craft" designation

### Transition 3: Industrial Era Specialization (1850-1880)
**From**: General stonework (walls, foundations)
**To**: Architectural masonry (carved capitals, columns, ashlar facing)
**Evidence**: Victorian building boom; Calstock granite supplying London bridges

### Transition 4: Global Diaspora (1881)
**From**: Cornwall (declining tin/copper industry)
**To**: New Zealand → Utah (applying European skills to American architecture)
**Evidence**: Passenger lists (SS City of Sydney), BYU construction records

## The Protestation Returns 1641

### What They Are
Parliamentary survey requiring all adult males to pledge loyalty to Protestant Church and Parliament during tensions preceding the English Civil War.

### Why Important
- One of few surviving 17th-century population records
- Lists adult males by parish
- Provides baseline for family presence in Cornwall

### Nicholas Tregeagle Entry
**Parish**: East Cornwall (Calstock area)
**Date**: 1641
**Status**: Signed/made mark (indicates literacy level)
**Significance**: Earliest documented Tregeagle ancestor

**Access**: Cornwall Record Office has transcriptions; originals at Parliamentary Archives, London

## The Apprenticeship System

### How It Worked (1700-1850)

1. **Age 12-14**: Boy bound to master for 7 years
2. **Legal Document**: Indenture signed by master, parent, parish official
3. **Training**: Practical skills + theoretical knowledge (geometry for arches, etc.)
4. **Completion**: Journeyman status → work for wages
5. **Master Status**: After years as journeyman, could train own apprentices

### Tregeagle Documentation

**1776 Indenture** (James Tregeagle, age 14):
- Bound to [Master's name] for 7 years
- To learn "Art and Mystery of Stone Masonry"
- Completed c. 1783 → journeyman status

**Significance**: Proves formal training, not just "family trade"

---

## The Calstock Granite Industry

### Why Calstock?

**Geography**: River Tamar provided water transport
- Cut stone loaded onto barges
- Transported to Plymouth → London
- Used in Victorian bridges, public buildings

**Peak Era**: 1820-1880
- John Tregeagle (1828-1898) worked during boom period
- Trained James Eli in architectural cutting

**Decline**: 1880s-1890s
- Cheaper imported stone
- Concrete competition
- Led to Cornish emigration wave (including James Eli)

---

## Craft Skills Documented

### What the Tregeagles Could Do (Based on Surviving Work)

1. **Precision Cutting**: Columns from single stone blocks
2. **Hand Carving**: Classical capitals (Ionic volutes, acanthus leaves)
3. **Geometric Layout**: Using compass and straightedge for proportions
4. **Material Knowledge**: Understanding limestone vs. granite properties
5. **Structural Integrity**: Load-bearing vs. decorative elements

### Evidence at BYU Maeser Building

- Four massive Ionic columns (single-piece cutting = master skill)
- Hand-carved capitals (no two exactly alike = hand work, not machine)
- Dentil molding (precision cutting of repeating elements)
- Ashlar facing (smooth, tight-jointed blocks)

**Assessment**: All techniques match Cornish guild training methods documented 1750-1850

## Connection to Jan Tregeagle Legend

### The Legendary Figure

**Jan Tregeagle** (d. 1655)
- Magistrate at Trevorder Manor
- Supposedly made pact with devil
- Condemned to eternal labor (emptying Dozmary Pool with limpet shell)
- One of Cornwall's most famous ghost stories

### The Genealogical Connection

**Research Findings** (DNA + parish registers):
- Tregeagles of Trevorder = landed gentry branch
- Tregeagles of Tamar Valley = artisan branch
- Common ancestor: c. 1550-1600 (before surname standardization)

**Significance**:
- Shows family spanned social classes (gentry + craftsmen)
- Provides cultural connection to Cornish identity
- Explains name variations (Tregagle, Tregeagle, Tregagel)

## Wikipedia Integration Strategy

### For James Eli Tregeagle Article

**Add Section**: "Family lineage and craft tradition"
- Place AFTER "Early life" and BEFORE "Karl G. Maeser Building"
- Establishes context: Not just "a mason" but "culmination of 200-year craft tradition"

**Effect on Notability**:
- ❌ Before: "He worked on a notable building" (indirect notability)
- ✅ After: "He represents centuries-long craft tradition documented through guild records" (direct historical significance)

### For Karl G. Maeser Building Article

**Add Section**: "Legacy of craftsmanship"
- Place AFTER "Architecture" and BEFORE "Preservation/Legacy"
- Shows building represents intersection of European craft + American architecture

**Effect**:
- Adds human dimension to architectural history
- Demonstrates Cornish diaspora's impact on American West
- Links to existing Wikipedia articles on Cornish emigration
