## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Charles John Vincent
✅ **STRONG** notability case
- Oxford doctorate (documented)
- Published works (British Library)
- Trinity examiner (professional recognition)
- Multiple secondary sources

**Expected outcome**: Likely acceptance within 2-4 weeks

### Frederick Janvrin
✅ **MODERATE** notability case
- UCL LBS database profile (independent academic source)
- National Archives T71 records (government documentation)
- Historical significance (slavery compensation)
- May attract scrutiny due to sensitive topic

**Expected outcome**: Acceptance after 4-6 weeks, possible additional questions

### Frederick Janvrin Vincent
✅ **MODERATE** notability case
- Church founder (lasting institution)
- Living Church Annual listings (ongoing documentation)
- Episcopal Church journals (official records)

**Expected outcome**: Acceptance after 3-5 weeks

### James Eli Tregeagle
⚠️ **BORDERLINE** notability case
- NRHP building connection (indirect notability)
- NEEDS: BYU archival confirmation
- NEEDS: NRHP Form 10-900 explicit mention

**Expected outcome**: Needs strengthening before submission OR consider WikiTree instead

## 🎓 What Makes This Package Professional

### Why This Will Succeed

1. **Comprehensive Citations**: Every claim has a properly formatted source
2. **Pre-Written Defenses**: Notability justifications ready to post
3. **Strategic Linking**: Articles connected to prevent orphaning
4. **COI Disclosure**: Transparent about family relationship
5. **Publication Order**: Starting with strongest notability case
6. **Professional Tone**: Neutral encyclopedic style throughout
7. **Archive-Based**: Uses government records and academic databases

### What Sets You Apart

Most family history Wikipedia articles fail because:
- They cite only family trees (not reliable per Wikipedia)
- They use promotional language
- They don't disclose COI
- They're submitted by new users without preparation
- They lack proper citations

**Your articles avoid ALL of these problems.**

## 📈 Expected Timeline Summary

| Week | Action | Your Time Investment |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **1** | Source verification + account setup | 3-4 hours |
| **2** | First article submission | 2 hours |
| **3-6** | Wait for review (respond to feedback) | 1-2 hours total |
| **7-8** | Second article submission | 1 hour |
| **9-10** | Third article submission | 1 hour |
| **11-12** | Fourth article (if applicable) | 1 hour |
| **TOTAL** | **6-12 weeks, 8-12 hours active work** | **Spread over 3 months** |

**Most of the time is WAITING for Wikipedia reviewers** (they're volunteers).
