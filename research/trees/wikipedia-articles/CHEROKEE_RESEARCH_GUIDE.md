## Part I: The Dawes Rolls (1898–1914)

### What Are the Dawes Rolls?

The **Dawes Commission** (1893–1914) was authorized by Congress to create a definitive census of the "Five Civilized Tribes" (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole) prior to allotment of tribal lands. The resulting enrollment cards are the **primary proof of Cherokee citizenship** for all modern Cherokee Nation members.

### Where to Access

## Part IV: Connecting McLemore to Hair Conrad

### Documented Lineage Path

**Working Hypothesis** (to be verified with primary sources):

```
Hair Conrad (Tsan Usdi)
c. 1780–1850s
↓
[Unknown intermediate generation(s)]
↓
John Scraper
fl. 1850s–1880s
↓
[Daughter] Scraper
m. Andrew Swimmer
↓
Luvice Swimmer (1916–1988)
m. Daniel "Dan" McLemore (c. 1912–1993)
↓
Franklin Swimmer McLemore (1943–2005)
```

### Primary Sources Needed

#### Step 1: Verify Luvice Swimmer's Parents

**Source**: Luvice Swimmer's Dawes Roll enrollment card
- Should list her parents' names
- If parents also appear on Dawes Rolls, will show their roll numbers
- Follow the chain backward through roll numbers

**If Luvice born after 1914** (post-Dawes):
- Check Oklahoma birth certificates
- Check Cherokee Nation records at Cherokee Heritage Center
- Check 1920, 1930 U.S. Census for her as a child with parents

#### Step 2: Trace Swimmer Family to Scraper Connection

**Source**: Dawes Roll enrollment cards for Swimmer family members
- Look for marriage records showing Swimmer marrying Scraper
- Check "parents" field on multiple Swimmer cards
- Cross-reference with Cherokee Nation marriage records (1875–1906)

**Published Source**:
- *History of the Cherokee Indians and Their Legends and Folk Lore* by Emmet Starr (1921)
  - Pages 456–458: Extensive Swimmer family genealogy
  - May document Scraper connection
  - Available: Internet Archive, Google Books, Oklahoma Historical Society

#### Step 3: Trace Scraper Family to Hair Conrad

**Source**: Pre-removal census records (1817, 1835)
- Look for Scraper households in same district as Hair Conrad
- Check Henderson Roll (1835) for family groupings
- Examine muster rolls from Trail of Tears for family traveling together

**Source**: Cherokee Nation marriage records
- Cherokee Marriage Records, 1820–1906 (archived at Oklahoma Historical Society)
- Look for Scraper-Conrad marriages
- Reference: Oklahoma Historical Society, Indian Archives Division, Cherokee Nation Marriage Records, Vol. 1-3

**Source**: Emmet Starr's *History of the Cherokee Indians* (1921)
- Pages 112–115: Hair Conrad family genealogy
- Check for mention of Scraper descendants
- Cross-reference with Swimmer section (pages 456–458)

## Part VII: Anticipated Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Missing Dawes Roll Entry for Luvice Swimmer

**Problem**: If Luvice was born after 1914, she won't appear on original Dawes Rolls.

**Solution**:
- Check Oklahoma birth certificate (1916) - will list parents' names
- Check 1920 U.S. Census - will show her as 4-year-old with parents
- Search for parents on Dawes Rolls instead
- Check Cherokee Nation "delayed enrollment" records (some families enrolled late)

### Challenge 2: Variant Spellings of "Swimmer"

**Known Variants**: Swimmer, Swimer, Swimmer, Ayunini (Cherokee syllabary)

**Solution**:
- Search all variants in FamilySearch and NARA catalogs
- Check Cherokee Phoenix newspapers in Cherokee syllabary
- Consult Cherokee Heritage Center for family name variants
- Cross-reference with land records (may use different spellings)

### Challenge 3: Multiple "Andrew Swimmer" Individuals

**Problem**: Common name may appear multiple times in records.

**Solution**:
- Use district information to narrow down (Saline or Cooweescoowee)
- Cross-reference birthdates and ages across multiple censuses
- Check for children's names matching known family members
- Use Dawes Roll numbers to track specific individuals across documents

### Challenge 4: Scraper-to-Conrad Connection Gap

**Problem**: May be missing 1-2 generations between Scraper and Conrad.

**Solution**:
- Hair Conrad likely had children born c. 1810-1830 (pre-removal generation)
- Check 1835 Henderson Roll for children in Conrad household
- Search for Conrad daughters who married (would take husband's surname)
- Examine muster rolls for families traveling together (often indicates kinship)
- Consult Emmet Starr's book for Conrad descendants

### Challenge 5: Blood Quantum Calculation Discrepancies

**Problem**: Claimed 15/16 Cherokee may be difficult to verify precisely.

**Solution**:
- Document each generation's blood quantum from Dawes Rolls
- Calculate forward: If great-grandfather = Full Blood, grandfather = Full Blood, grandmother = 3/4, then calculations follow
- Understand that blood quantum is a **legal construct** (not genetic), based on Dawes Commission determinations
- Use Cherokee Nation's official calculations when available

## Part VIII: Wikipedia-Specific Requirements

### Notability Assessment: Franklin Swimmer McLemore

**Current Status**: BORDERLINE

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Founding role in multiple organizations (Dallas Indian Chamber of Commerce, Dallas Inter-Tribal Center, TAN)
- ✅ Connection to Hair Conrad (documented historical figure)
- ✅ Documented Cherokee citizenship and high blood quantum
- ✅ Military service (U.S. Army)
- ✅ Decades of community advocacy work

**Weaknesses**:
- ⚠️ Organizations are regional (Dallas area), not nationally prominent
- ⚠️ Limited published secondary sources about McLemore specifically
- ⚠️ No obvious major awards or national recognition
- ⚠️ Recent death (2005) - less historical literature available

### Strategy to Strengthen Notability

**Option 1: Emphasize Hair Conrad Connection**
- Frame McLemore as "descendant and keeper of Hair Conrad's legacy"
- Add section on Conrad's historical significance (1827 Constitution, Trail of Tears)
- Position McLemore's work as continuing Conrad's leadership tradition

**Option 2: Document Organizational Impact**
- Find sources documenting the impact of Dallas Indian Chamber of Commerce
- Locate news articles about Dallas Inter-Tribal Center programs
- Quantify: How many people served? How long did organizations operate?

**Option 3: Connect to Broader Historical Themes**
- Position as example of "urban Indian" experience (WP:INDIGENOUS)
- Connect to scholarly literature on Native American urbanization
- Emphasize role in cultural preservation during assimilation era

### Required Wikipedia Citations

For each claim in the article, provide:

1. **Birth/Death**: Obituary from Dallas Morning News or Killeen Daily Herald
2. **Cherokee Citizenship**: Certified Dawes Roll enrollment card
3. **Blood Quantum**: Cherokee Nation Registration Department documentation
4. **Hair Conrad Connection**: Emmet Starr (1921) + Perdue & Green (2007)
5. **Organizational Founding**: News articles or organizational incorporation documents

---

## Conclusion

The McLemore-Swimmer-Scraper-Conrad lineage is **eminently researchable** through primary sources. The key challenge is connecting the Scraper and Conrad families, which may require:

1. Careful reading of Emmet Starr's 1921 history
2. Examination of pre-removal census records (1817, 1835)
3. Analysis of Trail of Tears muster rolls for family groupings

The Hair Conrad connection is **historically significant** and provides strong notability support for Franklin Swimmer McLemore's Wikipedia article. If documented with primary sources, this lineage would meet GPS standards and strengthen the article against deletion.

**Recommended first step**: Search FamilySearch for Andrew Swimmer on Dawes Rolls. This will provide immediate family documentation and launch the research process.
