## 🚀 Step-by-Step Publication Instructions

### Step 1: Create Wikipedia Account (If Needed)

1. Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/
2. Click "Create account" (top right)
3. Choose username (suggest: Your real name or "Sparks19923" as mentioned)
4. Complete registration
5. **IMPORTANT**: Wait 4 days before creating articles (Wikipedia's "autoconfirmed" requirement)

**Why the wait?** Wikipedia requires new accounts to be at least 4 days old and have made 10 edits before creating new articles. This prevents spam.

### Step 2: Make Your First 10 Edits (Required)

To become "autoconfirmed," you need 10 edits. Here's how:

**Easy first edits:**
1. Fix typos in existing articles (search for "typo" on Wikipedia)
2. Add citations to articles marked with "citation needed"
3. Improve formatting in stub articles
4. Add missing birth/death dates to biographical articles
5. Correct grammar errors

**Tips:**
- Make genuine improvements, not trivial changes
- Use edit summaries (explain what you changed)
- Follow Wikipedia's style guidelines

### Step 3: Upload to Your Sandbox

Once your account is 4 days old with 10+ edits:

1. Go to your sandbox: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:YourUsername/Sandbox`
2. Click "Edit source" (NOT "Edit")
3. **Copy-paste the entire contents** of one .wiki file
4. Click "Publish changes"
5. Review how it looks

**Start with Charles John Vincent** (strongest notability case).

### Step 4: Move from Sandbox to Main Wikipedia

#### Method A: Articles for Creation (Recommended for New Users)

1. At the top of your sandbox page, add this template:
   ```
   {{subst:AFC submission|ts=~~~~~}}
   ```
2. This submits your article for review by experienced editors
3. Wait 1-6 weeks for review (Wikipedia reviewers are volunteers)
4. Respond to any feedback and revise as needed

#### Method B: Direct Creation (For Experienced Users)

1. Search for the article title (e.g., "Charles John Vincent")
2. If no article exists, you'll see "Create this page"
3. Click "Create this page"
4. Copy-paste the wikitext from your .wiki file
5. Add edit summary: "Creating article on Victorian composer/organist"
6. Click "Publish page"

- [x] Oxford doctorate documented (1885)
- [x] Trinity College examiner role mentioned
- [x] British Library holdings referenced
- [ ] **OBTAIN**: Confirm British Library catalogue entry (search their online catalogue)

### Frederick Janvrin

- [x] National Archives T71 references
- [x] Jersey Heritage archive codes
- [ ] **VERIFY**: UCL LBS database person ID is accurate (check https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/)

## ⚠️ Wikipedia Notability Concerns

### Who Might Face Challenges?

**James Eli Tregeagle** (Most Vulnerable)
- **Issue**: Notability through association (worked on notable building)
- **Risk**: Wikipedia may argue he's not independently notable
- **Mitigation**:
  - Request BYU archives for construction records showing his name
  - Find newspaper articles from 1910-1911 about the Maeser Building naming him
  - Look for business directory listings for Belmont Stone Company

**Frederick Janvrin** (Moderate Risk)
- **Issue**: Historical figure known primarily through slavery records
- **Risk**: Wikipedia editors may debate if slave ownership alone confers notability
- **Mitigation**:
  - Emphasize his role as a major Channel Islands merchant
  - Reference Jersey Heritage archives (independent of slavery records)
  - Note the LBS database is an academic/historical resource (UCL)

**Other Two** (Should Pass Review)
- Charles John Vincent: Academic credentials + published works = clear notability
- Frederick Janvrin Vincent: Church founder + documented missionary = clear notability

## 📖 Wikipedia Policies to Understand

### 1. Neutral Point of View (NPOV)
✅ **Good**: "He founded St. Peter's Church in 1896"
❌ **Bad**: "He heroically founded St. Peter's Church despite opposition"

**Your articles**: Already written in neutral tone ✅

### 2. Verifiability (V)
✅ **Good**: Every statement has a <ref> citation
❌ **Bad**: "He was a skilled mason" (no source)

**Your articles**: All key facts cited ✅

### 3. No Original Research (NOR)
✅ **Good**: "The National Archives documents show..."
❌ **Bad**: "Based on the records, he probably felt..."

**Your articles**: No original research present ✅

### 4. Notability (N)
✅ **Notable**: Subject has received significant coverage in reliable, independent sources
❌ **Not Notable**: Subject only mentioned in family trees or self-published sources

**Your articles**: Varying levels (see assessment above)

## 🔧 Common Wikipedia Editing Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Citation Needed" Tags

**What it looks like**: {{citation needed}}
**Why it happens**: Reviewers want a source for a specific claim
**How to fix**: Add a <ref> tag with appropriate archive reference

### Issue 2: "Notability" Challenges

**What happens**: Reviewer may nominate article for deletion (AfD)
**How to respond**: Provide additional sources showing independent coverage
**Defense strategy**: Point to academic databases (LBS), government archives (NRHP), institutional records

### Issue 3: "Conflicts of Interest" (COI)

**Wikipedia concern**: Family members writing about relatives
**How to handle**:
- Disclose relationship: "Note: I am a descendant researching family history"
- Use only verifiable sources (no family stories)
- Avoid promotional language
- Focus on documented facts

**Your advantage**: You're citing archives, not family memories ✅

## 🎯 Publication Order Strategy

### Recommended Order (Easiest to Hardest)

1. **Charles John Vincent** (Start here)
   - Strongest notability case
   - Builds your Wikipedia editing credibility
   - If accepted, improves chances for later submissions

2. **Frederick Janvrin Vincent**
   - Moderate notability
   - Church founder status is well-documented
   - Can reference Charles John Vincent article (his brother)

3. **Frederick Janvrin**
   - Historical significance clear
   - LBS database provides independent verification
   - May attract scrutiny due to slavery topic (be prepared)

4. **James Eli Tregeagle** (Save for last)
   - Most challenging notability case
   - **Before submitting**: Try to obtain BYU archival documents
   - Consider reaching out to BYU Special Collections first (see byu-special-collections-request-letter.md)

**Alternative Strategy**: Submit all four simultaneously via "Articles for Creation" and let reviewers prioritize.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do:
✅ Use the <ref></ref> system for all citations
✅ Write in encyclopedic tone (neutral, factual)
✅ Link to other Wikipedia articles using [[Article Name]]

✅ Respond politely to reviewer feedback
✅ Be patient (Wikipedia reviews can take weeks)

### Don't:
❌ Add promotional language ("amazing," "revolutionary")
❌ Include family stories without archival proof

❌ Cite family trees as sources (not reliable per Wikipedia)
❌ Give up after first rejection (revise and resubmit)

### Wikitext Formatting Used

### Categories Explained

Each article has categories at the bottom like:
```
[[Category:1852 births]]
[[Category:English composers]]
```

These organize Wikipedia articles. Reviewers may add more categories or suggest changes.
