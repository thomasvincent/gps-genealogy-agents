# Ancestral Accountability Section
## For Inclusion in Family History Binder

---

## Purpose of This Section

**Why include this:** Complete family history requires acknowledging both accomplishments and the sources of wealth that made those accomplishments possible. For the Vincent-Janvrin line, that wealth derived from participation in the transatlantic slave economy.

**Principles:**
- Tell the whole truth, not just the comfortable parts
- Acknowledge the enslaved people whose labor created family wealth
- Distinguish between individuals (direct participants vs. those who inherited)
- Consider reparative actions for descendants

## The Janvrin Family: Wealth from Slavery

### Summary

The Janvrin family of St. Brelade, Jersey, Channel Islands—ancestors of Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent through his mother Amelia Janvrin (1829-1904)—built their maritime fortune through direct and indirect participation in the transatlantic slave economy during the 18th and early 19th centuries.

When slavery was abolished in British colonies (1834), the Janvrin family received government compensation for "lost property" (enslaved people). This money became part of the inherited wealth that funded Frederick Janvrin Vincent's education, ordination, and missionary work across the American West (1881-1920).

## Documented Involvement

### Direct Ownership: Compensation Claims (1833-1835)

When the British Parliament abolished slavery in 1833, they allocated £20 million in compensation—paid to slave owners, not to enslaved people. Janvrin family members filed multiple claims:

**1. John Janvrin**
- **Location:** British Guiana (now Guyana)
- **Claim number:** #759
- **Role:** Owner/Claimant
- **Status:** Direct plantation ownership
- **Compensation:** For enslaved individuals on a plantation
- **Source:** Legacies of British Slavery Database (UCL); National Archives T71 Records

**2. Frederick Janvrin**
- **Location:** Antigua, Caribbean
- **Claim numbers:** #138, #182, #372 (multiple claims)
- **Role:** Owner/Assignee, Merchant-Owner, Mortgage holder
- **Status:** Direct ownership and financial mortgages on plantations
- **Pattern:** Held mortgages on plantations; when owners couldn't pay, enslaved people became Janvrin "property"
- **Source:** Legacies of British Slavery Database (UCL); National Archives T71/877

**3. Philip & Francis Janvrin (Merchant Partnership)**
- **Locations:** Multiple West Indies islands
- **Role:** Merchant-bankers, Assignees, Financiers
- **Pattern:** Provided credit to plantation owners; when unpaid, claimed mortgages on plantations (including enslaved people)
- **Source:** Jersey Heritage Archive, Janvrin Letter Books (L/C/40/B/2)

### Indirect Profit: The "Cod-Sugar Triangle" (1700s-1834)

**The trade pattern:**

1. **Newfoundland → Caribbean:**
   - Janvrin ships transported salt cod from Newfoundland fishing operations
   - Salt cod was primary protein source for enslaved workers on sugar plantations
   - Plantation owners purchased on credit from Janvrins

2. **Caribbean → Jersey/London:**
   - Ships returned loaded with sugar, molasses, and rum
   - ALL these products produced by enslaved labor
   - Sold in European markets for substantial profit

3. **Debt → Ownership:**
   - Many plantation owners couldn't pay for provisions
   - Janvrins took mortgages on plantations as collateral
   - Mortgages legally included enslaved people as "property"

**Economic reality:** The entire system was interdependent
- Without enslaved labor, no sugar/rum to transport
- Without salt cod shipments, enslaved workers couldn't be fed
- Janvrins profited at every step of the cycle

## Names from the Record: Remembering the Enslaved

From the 1832 Slave Registers (Antigua plantations where Janvrins held mortgages):

- **Quasheba**
- **Cudjoe**
- **Phillis**

These were real people with:
- Their own names, families, lives, dreams
- Forced labor that created the Janvrin wealth
- No compensation when slavery ended
- Descendants who may still live in Caribbean communities today

**These names must be remembered.**

## Distinguishing Between Individuals

**Not everyone in a family line bears equal responsibility:**

### Direct Participants (John Janvrin, Frederick Janvrin)
- Filed compensation claims for enslaved people
- Held mortgages on plantations
- Directly profited from slavery
- **Moral accountability:** Full responsibility for participation

### Inherited Wealth (Amelia Janvrin, 1829-1904)
- Born after peak of family's slave trade involvement
- Inherited wealth and status (not her choice)
- Brought this wealth to Vincent family marriage (1851)
- **Historical reality:** Benefited from slavery wealth without directly participating

### Born After Abolition (Frederick Janvrin Vincent, 1850-1920)
- Born 16 years after slavery abolished
- Never personally owned enslaved people
- Chose path of service (ministry, not profit)
- **But:** His education, opportunities, and financial security to found churches were funded by slavery wealth
- **Historical complexity:** Genuine service built on unjust foundation

## Comparison: Sources of Family Wealth

### Brown-Joyce Family (Irish Famine Survivors)
**Origin of wealth:** None - poverty and survival
**Starting point:** Famine refugees
**Labor:** Michael Brown worked the mines himself (manual labor)
**Social standing:** Working-class immigrants facing prejudice
**Opportunities:** Created through their own labor

### Vincent-Janvrin Family (Channel Islands Elite)
**Origin of wealth:** Slavery - direct ownership and provision trade
**Starting point:** Merchant elite, inherited capital
**Labor:** Merchant class, employed others (including enslaved people)
**Social standing:** Elite family with social connections
**Opportunities:** Funded by enslaved people's forced labor

**Both families ended up in California, both served their communities, but they started from vastly different places.**

## Reparative Considerations

### What Descendants Can Do Today

**1. Tell the Complete Truth**
- Include this chapter in any published family history
- Don't hide, minimize, or make excuses
- Present full documentation, not just assertions
- Teach this history to younger generations

**2. Research the Affected Communities**
- British Guiana (Guyana) - which plantation did John Janvrin own?
- Antigua - which estates (claims #138, #182, #372)?
- Are there descendant communities today?
- Can connections be made to those communities?

**3. Support Reparative Organizations**
- Caribbean Reparations Commission
- Scholarship funds for Caribbean students
- Organizations preserving slavery history
- Community organizations in Antigua and Guyana

**4. Acknowledge Privilege**
- Recognize that opportunities (education, wealth, social standing) derived from enslaved people's labor
- Understand that this isn't about personal guilt, but about historical accountability
- Use privilege to support justice today

**5. Donate to Relevant Causes**
- Education/scholarship funds for descendants of enslaved people
- Historical preservation (plantation sites, slave burial grounds)
- Community development in Caribbean nations
- Organizations working on slavery legacy issues

- "We can honor ancestors' service while being honest about the source of their opportunities"

### In Public Settings (WikiTree, Published Genealogies)

**Be explicit:**
- Don't use euphemisms like "merchant trade" or "Caribbean business"
- State clearly: "wealth derived from slavery"
- Provide sources and documentation
- Acknowledge the enslaved people by name when records exist

## Final Statement

The narrative of Reverend Frederick Janvrin Vincent is one of genuine service. He dedicated his life to founding churches on the American frontier, often in difficult conditions. His "Two-Year Foundation" pattern demonstrates sacrificial commitment.

But his story cannot be told completely without acknowledging that his education, his ordination, and his ability to move his family across continents were made possible by wealth generated through the forced labor of enslaved Africans and their descendants in the Caribbean.

**Quasheba. Cudjoe. Phillis.** And hundreds of others whose names we don't know.

They worked the plantations that enriched the Janvrin family. They received no compensation when slavery ended. Their descendants may still live in Antigua and Guyana today.

This is not about guilt. Frederick Janvrin Vincent was born after abolition and chose a path of service.

This is about **accountability**: Telling the complete truth about where opportunities came from, so that we can make informed choices about how to use those opportunities today.
