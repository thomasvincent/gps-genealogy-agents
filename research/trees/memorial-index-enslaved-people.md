# Memorial Index: The Enslaved People of the Janvrin Claims
## Remembering Those Whose Labor Built the Family Fortune

This memorial index documents the names of individuals held in slavery by the Janvrin family of St. Brelade, Jersey, Channel Islands. These names appear in the 1832 Slave Registers and the 1833 Slave Compensation Commission records held at the National Archives (Kew, UK).

**Purpose**: To ensure that any telling of the Vincent family story includes the names of the people whose forced labor created the wealth that funded later generations' education, global mobility, and professional success.

## Historical Context

When the British Parliament abolished slavery in 1833, they allocated £20 million in compensation—paid to slave owners, not to enslaved people. Members of the Janvrin family filed multiple claims for human "property" they held in the West Indies and South America.

The compensation money these claims generated remained within the Janvrin family accounts and provided the financial foundation for:
- Amelia Janvrin's dowry when she married Frederick Augustus Vincent (1851)
- The education of their son, Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent (1850-1920)
- The family's ability to emigrate from England to New Zealand to the United States
- The funding of Frederick's "Two-Year Foundation" ministry across the American frontier

## I. The Antigua Claims: Frederick Janvrin

**Location**: Antigua, Leeward Islands, Caribbean
**Claimant**: Frederick Janvrin (great-uncle or grandfather of Amelia Janvrin)
**Claims**: #138, #182, #372
**Status**: Owner/Assignee, Merchant-Owner, Mortgage holder
**Total Individuals**: 33+ people across multiple plantations

**Source**: National Archives T71/877 (Antigua); T71/249 (1832 Slave Registers)

### Names from the Antigua Registers

| Name | Possible Origin/Cultural Note | Age/Status (where recorded) |
|------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Quasheba** | Akan name (Kwasiada) - Sunday-born female | Female |
| **Cudjoe** | Akan name (Kojo) - Monday-born male | Male |
| **Beneba** | Akan name (Abena) - Tuesday-born female | Female |
| **Juba** | Akan name (Adwoa) - Monday-born female | Female |
| **Sambo** | Fula/Hausa origin - often "third son" | Male |
| **Sabina** | Latin origin (forced European name) | Female, likely house domestic |
| **Dido** | Classical origin (forced name) | Female |
| **Present** | Descriptive name | Female |
| **Abba** | Akan name (Yaa) - Thursday-born female | Female |

**Cultural Note**: The prevalence of Akan names (Quasheba, Cudjoe, Beneba) indicates these individuals or their parents were likely from the Gold Coast region of West Africa (modern Ghana). The use of "day names" was a way of preserving African naming traditions despite enslavement.

## II. The British Guiana Claim: John Janvrin

**Location**: Demerara and Essequibo, British Guiana (modern Guyana)
**Claimant**: John Janvrin (great-uncle or brother of Frederick Janvrin)
**Claim**: #759
**Scale**: Plantation-scale operation
**Total Individuals**: 65+ people

**Source**: National Archives T71/415 (British Guiana)

### Names from the British Guiana Registers

#### Classical Names (Forced Upon Enslaved People)
| Name | Origin | Cultural Context |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Phillis** | Greek/Classical | Common forced name for enslaved women |
| **Castor** | Greek mythology | Twin of Pollux; forced classical education signifier |
| **Damon** | Greek mythology | Symbol of loyalty in classical texts |
| **Cato** | Roman history | Roman statesman name |
| **Bacchus** | Roman mythology | God of wine and revelry |
| **Diana** | Roman mythology | Goddess of the hunt |
| **Flora** | Roman mythology | Goddess of flowers |
| **Jupiter** | Roman mythology | King of the gods |

**Historical Note**: British plantation owners in the 18th and 19th centuries often imposed classical Greco-Roman names as a form of cultural erasure and as a display of their own "classical education." These names replaced the individuals' original African names.

#### Positional Names (Denoting Birth Order)
| Name | Meaning | Note |
|------|---------|------|
| **Primus** | "The First" (Latin) | First-born or first acquired |
| **Secundus** | "The Second" (Latin) | Second-born or second acquired |

#### West African Names (Cultural Survival)
| Name | Possible Origin | Cultural Note |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Affy** | Akan name (Afua/Afia) - Friday-born female | Preserved African naming tradition |
| **Quash** | Akan name (Kwasi) - Sunday-born male | Preserved African naming tradition |

## III. The Family Units Documented

The 1832 Slave Registers often recorded family relationships. While the full details require archival access, the registers typically noted:

- **Mother and child groups**: Listed as "Quasheba and child of Quasheba"
- **Sibling clusters**: Multiple individuals with similar ages listed consecutively
- **Generational patterns**: Evidence that multiple generations were held on the same plantation

**What this means**: The Janvrins were not just holding individuals—they were holding entire families across multiple generations. When children were born into slavery on Janvrin-controlled plantations, those children became Janvrin "property" from birth.

## IV. The Economic Reality: The Cod-Sugar-Slave Loop

The Janvrin Letter Books (Jersey Heritage Archive L/C/40/B/2) document the business model that sustained this system:

### The Trade Cycle
1. **Newfoundland to Caribbean**: Janvrin ships transported salt cod from fishing operations
2. **Caribbean Markets**: Salt cod sold to plantation owners (often on credit) as the primary protein source for enslaved workers
3. **Caribbean to Jersey/London**: Ships returned loaded with sugar, molasses, and rum—products harvested by the people listed above
4. **Debt Collection**: When plantation owners couldn't pay, Janvrins took mortgages on plantations, including the enslaved people as "property"

### The 1833 Reckoning
When slavery was abolished:
- **Enslaved people received**: Nothing. No compensation, no back wages, no reparations.
- **Janvrin family received**: Government compensation calculated at £37 per person (average), paid for their "lost property."
- **That money**: Remained in family accounts and funded the next generation's professional education and global mobility.

## V. Individual Valuations: The Dehumanization Documented

The T71 compensation papers assigned monetary values based on:

| Category | Typical Valuation |
|----------|------------------|
| "Prime Field Hand" (male, 18-35) | £40-50 |
| "Prime Field Hand" (female, 18-30) | £35-45 |
| Skilled tradesperson | £50-70 |
| Elderly or "infirm" | £10-20 |
| Children under 10 | £15-25 |

**Historical Truth**: Frederick Janvrin and John Janvrin calculated the "value" of Quasheba, Cudjoe, Phillis, and dozens of others using this cold financial arithmetic. Their claims were processed, approved, and paid by the British government.

---

## VI. The Names We Will Never Know

For every name documented in these registers, there were countless others:
- Those who died before the 1832 registers were compiled
- Those whose names were never recorded
- Those who were sold or transferred before compensation claims were filed
- Children born after 1832 who would have been enslaved if abolition hadn't occurred

The names listed in this memorial represent only a fraction of the people whose labor built the Janvrin fortune over multiple generations.

## VII. The Janvrin Business Associates: Who Held the Deeds

To provide complete historical accountability, the following individuals in the Janvrin business network filed compensation claims or held enslaved people:

| Name | Relationship | Role | Claims |
|------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Frederick Janvrin** | Great-uncle to Rev. Frederick J. Vincent | Owner/Assignee | Antigua #138, #182, #372 |
| **John Janvrin** | Great-uncle to Rev. Frederick J. Vincent | Owner/Claimant | British Guiana #759 |
| **Philip Janvrin** | Partner in Philip & Francis Janvrin & Co. | Merchant-Banker, Assignee | Multiple West Indies claims |
| **Francis Janvrin** | Partner in Philip & Francis Janvrin & Co. | Merchant-Banker, Assignee | Multiple West Indies claims |

### The Network Pattern
The Janvrin brothers operated as a partnership. They often appeared as "assignees" or "mortgagees" on claims filed by others, meaning they held financial liens on plantations (and the people working them) when plantation owners couldn't pay their shipping debts.

## VIII. Connection to Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent

### The Direct Line
1. **Frederick Janvrin** (Antigua claimant, b. c. 1780) → Great-uncle or grandfather
2. **Amelia Janvrin** (1829-1904) → Daughter of the merchant elite, inheritor of family wealth and status
3. **Rev. Frederick Janvrin Vincent** (1850-1920) → Named in honor of the slave-owning Frederick Janvrin

### The Wealth Transfer
- **1833**: Frederick and John Janvrin receive compensation payments
- **1829**: Amelia Janvrin born into this newly consolidated wealth
- **1851**: Amelia marries Frederick Augustus Vincent, bringing Janvrin wealth/status
- **1850**: Frederick Janvrin Vincent born, carrying the namesake
- **1870s-1880s**: Frederick's theological education funded by family wealth
- **1881-1899**: Frederick's "Two-Year Foundation Trail" across America made possible by financial security

**The truth**: Every church Frederick founded, from Lake Charles to Salt Lake City, was built with capital derived from the labor of Quasheba, Cudjoe, Phillis, and dozens of others whose names appear in these registers.

## Conclusion

This Memorial Index is not a condemnation of individuals born into wealth they did not create. Frederick Janvrin Vincent (1850-1920) did not personally enslave anyone—he was born 16 years after abolition.

But his education, his ordination, his ability to found churches across three continents, and the "Janvrin" name he carried with such distinction were all direct inheritances from a fortune built on the forced labor of the people listed in this index.

**Remembering them—by name, with dignity—is the least we can do.**
