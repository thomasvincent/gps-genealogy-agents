### James Eli Tregeagle's Parallel Path (Laura's Brother)

## 3. The Ancient Janvrin Origins (Colonial Wave)

**Pattern:** Channel Islands → Colonial New England → Massachusetts

| Location | Coordinates | Years | Significance |
|----------|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Saint Brelade, Jersey** | 49.1925° N, 2.1936° W | pre-1700 | Janvrin ancestral home |
| (Channel Islands) | | | Seafaring/merchant family |
| **Portsmouth, New Hampshire** | 43.0718° N, 70.7626° W | c. 1700 | **Jean (John) Janvrin** arrival |
| | | 1707 | John Janvrin born (first documented in New England) |
| **Massachusetts** | 42.4072° N, 71.3824° W | 1700s-1800s | Primary Janvrin settlement |
| | | | By 1840: 67% of all US Janvrins lived here |
| | | c. 1885 | Frederick Augustus Vincent (Frederick's father) settles here |

### The Janvrin Network Effect

The Janvrin surname's established presence in Massachusetts (1700-1880s) explains:
1. Why Frederick Augustus Vincent (Frederick's father) chose Massachusetts (c. 1885)
2. Why Frederick J. Vincent could secure NY Diocese Missionary-at-Large role (1887) - family connections
3. The "cousin networks" that facilitated Frederick's East Coast foundations

## "GPS Pings": Children as Location Markers

Frederick J. Vincent's children serve as geographic markers of his foundation work:

| Child | Birth Year | Birth Location | Coordinates | Mission Phase |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Infant daughter | before 1881 | New Zealand | 43.5321° S, 172.6362° E | Pre-USA |
| Howard Bonnell | 1883 | Washington Territory | 47.7511° N, 120.7401° W | Early frontier work |
| Frederick Augustus Jr. | 1888 | Hudson Valley, NY | 41.7004° N, 73.9210° W | Missionary-at-Large |
| Earl | 1895 | Salt Lake City, UT | 40.7608° N, 111.8910° W | St. Peter's founding |
| Paul | 1897 | Salt Lake City, UT | 40.7608° N, 111.8910° W | St. Peter's dedication |

**Pattern:** A new child in each region = Frederick's longest stays (2-3 years)

---

## Time Zone Coverage

Frederick J. Vincent's foundations spanned **4 U.S. time zones:**

| Time Zone | Location | Years |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Pacific (UTC-8) | Washington, San Francisco | 1881-1883, 1899-1920 |
| Mountain (UTC-7) | Utah | 1894-1896 |
| Central (UTC-6) | Louisiana, Texas | 1885, 1893 |
