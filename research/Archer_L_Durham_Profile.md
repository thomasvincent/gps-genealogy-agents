## Historical Context

Major General Archer L. Durham was among the generation of African American Air Force officers who rose to senior leadership following the groundbreaking service of pioneers like:
- **Benjamin O. Davis Jr.** (1912-2002) - First African American USAF general (1954)
- **Daniel "Chappie" James Jr.** (1920-1978) - First African American four-star general (1975)

Durham's promotion to Brigadier General and subsequent advancement to Major General in the 1980s represented continued progress in military integration and African American achievement in the armed forces.
