**Archer Lyman Durham** (born June 9, 1932) is a retired United States Air Force Major General who served as Director of Deployment at U.S. Transportation Command and as Commander of the 436th Military Airlift Wing at Dover Air Force Base. He is notable for his Cherokee Freedmen ancestry and for his legacy in promoting diversity and cultural awareness in the military.

## Early life and family

Durham was born on June 9, 1932, in Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California, to Barney M. Durham (c. 1895–?) and Ruby Zenobia Sorrell (c. 1903–?).[1] His father was born in Georgia, and his mother was born in Vinita, Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma).

### Cherokee Freedmen ancestry

Durham's maternal ancestry traces to the Cherokee Freedmen, African Americans who were formerly enslaved by Cherokee citizens and who became Cherokee citizens following the American Civil War under the Treaty of 1866.[2]

His maternal grandmother, **Ida Manley** (Dawes Roll #4136, Card #1515), was enrolled as a Cherokee Freedman. The enrollment record documents her marriage to **Morris A. Sorrell** (Cherokee Freedmen Card 193) on October 5, 1902.[3] Morris Sorrell was born May 28, 1874, in Indian Territory. The couple resided near Vinita in present-day Craig County, Oklahoma, and had at least one daughter, Ruby Zenobia Sorrell—Durham's mother.

Ida Manley's mother, **Kate Manley** (Dawes Roll #4135, Card #1515), headed a household of eight family members enrolled as Cherokee Freedmen:
- Kate Manley (Roll #4135)
- Ida Manley (Roll #4136)
- Frank Manley (Roll #4137)
- Sarah Manley (Roll #4138)
- Lela Manley (Roll #4139)
- Joseph Manley Jr. (Roll #4140)
- Willie Manley (Roll #4141)
- Daisy Manley (Roll #4142)

## Military career

Durham graduated from high school in Pasadena, California, and entered the United States Air Force.[4]

### Command positions

During his Air Force career, Durham held several significant command and staff positions:

- **Commander, 436th Military Airlift Wing**, Dover Air Force Base, Delaware – Led one of the Air Force's premier strategic airlift wings, operating C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Dover AFB became the first all-C-5 equipped wing in the USAF in 1973.[5]

- **Director of Deployment, U.S. Transportation Command**, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida – Served as the senior officer responsible for coordinating military deployment operations across all services. USTRANSCOM's Directorate of Deployment was established when the Joint Deployment Agency's missions transferred to USTRANSCOM on April 18, 1987.[6]

Durham retired from the Air Force at the rank of Major General (O-8), a two-star general officer.

## Legacy and honors

### Maj. Gen. Archer L. Durham Award

The **Maj. Gen. Archer L. Durham Award** was established at Dover Air Force Base in honor of the retired general. The award recognizes individuals who demonstrate exceptional leadership in fostering teamwork and awareness of various cultures.[7] The award reflects Durham's commitment to diversity and inclusion during his military career.

## Historical significance

Durham's career represents the intersection of two important threads of American history. As an African American with documented Cherokee Freedmen ancestry who rose to the rank of Major General, he exemplifies both the military service of Black Americans and the complex heritage of the Cherokee Freedmen community. The Cherokee Freedmen, descendants of people enslaved by Cherokee citizens, gained Cherokee citizenship under the Treaty of 1866 but faced ongoing struggles for recognition of their rights that continued into the 21st century.[8]
