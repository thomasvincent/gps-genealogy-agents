# The Durham-Sorrell-Manley Family History

## A Story of Cherokee Freedmen and American Achievement

*A Comprehensive Family History Document*

---

## Introduction

The story of Major General Archer Lyman Durham is a remarkable American narrative that spans from the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory to the highest ranks of the United States Air Force. His ancestry weaves together the history of the Cherokee Freedmen—African Americans who gained citizenship in the Cherokee Nation following the Civil War—and the Great Migration that brought Black families westward to California in search of new opportunities.

## Part I: The Cherokee Freedmen Heritage

### The Manley Family in the Cherokee Nation

The documented history of Archer Durham's maternal family begins with **Kate Manley**, a Cherokee Freedman living in the Cherokee Nation near Vinita, Indian Territory, in the late 19th century.

The Cherokee Freedmen were African Americans who had been enslaved by Cherokee citizens prior to the Civil War. Following the conflict, the Treaty of 1866 between the United States and the Cherokee Nation granted citizenship rights to these freedmen and their descendants. This treaty represented a significant milestone, recognizing the Freedmen as full Cherokee citizens with the same rights as other Cherokee by blood.

#### The Cherokee Freedmen Citizenship Dispute (1980s–2021)

The citizenship status of Cherokee Freedmen descendants became a contentious issue in the latter half of the 20th century. Beginning in the 1980s, the Cherokee Nation amended its citizenship requirements to include "by blood" language, effectively excluding Freedmen descendants who lacked documented Cherokee ancestry beyond the Dawes Rolls' Freedmen designation.

This dispute continued for decades, with Freedmen descendants arguing that the 1866 Treaty guaranteed their citizenship rights regardless of blood quantum. The matter was finally resolved through two landmark decisions:

1. **2017 Federal Court Ruling**: A U.S. federal court ruled that the 1866 Treaty remained binding and that Cherokee Freedmen descendants were entitled to full citizenship in the Cherokee Nation.

2. **2021 Cherokee Nation Supreme Court Ruling**: In February 2021, the Cherokee Nation Supreme Court struck down the "by blood" language from the tribal constitution, affirming that citizenship is not determined by blood quantum alone. This ruling formally ended the decades-long dispute and fully restored Freedmen descendants' citizenship rights.

Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland subsequently approved the new Cherokee Nation constitution, which guarantees full citizenship rights for all Freedmen descendants—a historic moment of reconciliation.

Kate Manley appears on the Dawes Rolls—the official enrollment of citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes conducted between 1898 and 1914. Her enrollment card (#1515) notes she was "Transferred from Cherokee Freedmen Card D628," indicating prior documentation of her citizenship status dating to earlier rolls. She was assigned Roll Number 4135.

Kate headed a household of eight family members, all enrolled as Cherokee Freedmen on the same card:

| Name | Dawes Roll Number | Relationship to Kate |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Kate Manley | #4135 | Head of household |
| Ida Manley | #4136 | Daughter |
| Frank Manley | #4137 | Son |
| Sarah Manley | #4138 | Daughter |
| Lela Manley | #4139 | Daughter |
| Joseph Manley Jr. | #4140 | Son |
| Willie Manley | #4141 | Son |
| Daisy Manley | #4142 | Daughter |

The family resided near Vinita, a town in what is now Craig County, Oklahoma. Vinita, established in 1871, was one of the first towns in Indian Territory and served as a significant commercial center along the railroad.

### The Sorrell Family and Marriage

**Morris A. Sorrell** (also recorded as Maurice Sorrell) was born on May 28, 1874, in Indian Territory. He was enrolled as Cherokee Freedmen on Card 193. The Sorrell surname appears in various records with alternate spellings including "Sorrel" and "Sorrells"—a common variation that our genealogical research tools are now designed to account for.

On **October 5, 1902**, Morris Sorrell married **Ida Manley**, Kate's daughter. This marriage is documented directly on the Dawes Roll Card #1515, which notes:

> *"Ida Manley married Morris A. Sorrel (Cherokee Freedmen Card 193) on October 5, 1902."*

The couple settled near Vinita and had at least one daughter:

**Ruby Zenobia Sorrell** was born around 1903 in Vinita, Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory. Her birth location and parentage are confirmed through Social Security Administration NUMIDENT records, which list her parents as Maurice Sorrell and Ida Madden (Manley). The "Madden" appears to be an alternate spelling or transcription of "Manley."

## Part II: The Westward Migration

### Ruby Sorrell and Barney Durham

The early 20th century saw significant African American migration from the South and Indian Territory to California, seeking economic opportunities and escaping the restrictions of Jim Crow laws. Ruby Sorrell was among those who made this journey.

In California, Ruby met and married **Barney M. Durham**, born around 1895 in Georgia. Barney represented another thread of the Great Migration—a Black man from the Deep South who had traveled west in search of a better life.

The Durhams settled in **Pasadena, Los Angeles County, California**, a city in the San Gabriel Valley that was home to a growing African American community. Pasadena in the early 1930s was a city of contrast—beautiful architecture and Rose Parade grandeur alongside racially restrictive housing covenants that limited where Black families could live.

### The Birth of Archer Lyman Durham

On **June 9, 1932**, during the depths of the Great Depression, Ruby and Barney Durham welcomed their son, **Archer Lyman Durham**, in Pasadena.

The 1940 United States Census records the Durham family residing in Pasadena:
- Barney M. Durham (approximately 45 years old)
- Ruby Z. Durham (approximately 37 years old)
- Archer L. Durham (7 years old)

Young Archer would grow up in Pasadena, attending local schools and graduating from high school there. He was coming of age during a transformative period in American history—World War II had recently ended, the military was beginning desegregation, and new opportunities were opening for African Americans in the armed forces.

## Part III: A Distinguished Military Career

### Rise to Major General

Archer Durham entered the United States Air Force following his high school graduation in Pasadena. He would go on to have a distinguished career spanning decades, rising through the ranks to become a two-star general—Major General (O-8).

#### Commander, 436th Military Airlift Wing

During his career, Durham served as **Commander of the 436th Military Airlift Wing** at **Dover Air Force Base, Delaware**. This was one of the Air Force's premier strategic airlift units.

The 436th Military Airlift Wing was activated on January 1, 1966, when the Military Air Transport Service was redesignated as Military Airlift Command (MAC). The wing operated at Dover AFB, which became the first all-C-5 Galaxy equipped wing in the United States Air Force in 1973. The C-5 Galaxy was (and remains) one of the largest military aircraft in the world, capable of carrying massive payloads across intercontinental distances.

As wing commander, Durham was responsible for:
- Strategic airlift operations worldwide
- Management of C-5 Galaxy aircraft and crews
- Base operations at Dover AFB
- Thousands of military and civilian personnel

#### Director of Deployment, U.S. Transportation Command

Durham's final major assignment was as **Director of Deployment** at the **United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)**, headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.

USTRANSCOM is one of the eleven Unified Combatant Commands of the United States military, responsible for coordinating transportation and logistics across all branches of the armed forces. The Directorate of Deployment was established on April 18, 1987, when the Joint Deployment Agency's missions and functions transferred to USTRANSCOM.

As Director of Deployment, Durham was the senior officer responsible for:
- Planning and coordinating military deployments worldwide
- Interservice logistics coordination
- Strategic transportation policy
- Deployment readiness across all military branches

## Part IV: Legacy and Recognition

### Cherokee Nation Medal of Patriotism Award (2024)

On December 2024, Major General Archer L. Durham received the **Medal of Patriotism Award** from the **Cherokee Nation** at the tribe's annual Holiday Awards Ceremony held at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The Medal of Patriotism is awarded to Cherokee Nation citizens who have served honorably in the United States armed forces. This recognition by the Cherokee Nation is particularly significant given Durham's Cherokee Freedmen heritage and the historical context of the citizenship dispute that was only fully resolved in 2021.

Durham's receipt of this award confirms his official status as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, completing a circle that began with his great-grandmother Kate Manley's enrollment on the Dawes Rolls over a century ago. The award recognizes not only his distinguished military service but also affirms the Cherokee Nation's commitment to honoring all of its citizens—including Freedmen descendants—who have served their country.

### The Maj. Gen. Archer L. Durham Award

Following his retirement from the Air Force, Major General Durham's legacy was honored with the establishment of the **Maj. Gen. Archer L. Durham Award** at Dover Air Force Base.

The award recognizes individuals who demonstrate exceptional leadership in **fostering teamwork and awareness of various cultures**. This recognition reflects Durham's commitment throughout his career to diversity, inclusion, and building bridges across different communities within the military.

The award continues to be presented annually, keeping Durham's legacy alive and inspiring new generations of airmen to embrace the values he championed.

### Historical Significance

Major General Archer L. Durham's life story represents the intersection of several important threads of American history:

1. **Cherokee Freedmen Heritage**: His documented ancestry through the Dawes Rolls connects him to the complex history of African Americans in Indian Territory and the decades-long struggle of Cherokee Freedmen for recognition of their citizenship rights. His 2024 Medal of Patriotism award from the Cherokee Nation symbolizes the resolution of this dispute and the full recognition of Freedmen descendants as Cherokee citizens.

2. **The Great Migration**: Both sides of his family participated in the great demographic movements of African Americans—from the Deep South (his father from Georgia) and from Indian Territory (his mother from Oklahoma) to California.

3. **African American Military Achievement**: Rising to the rank of Major General, Durham exemplifies the service and sacrifice of Black Americans in the United States military, following in the tradition of pioneers who broke barriers in the armed forces.

4. **Diversity and Inclusion**: The award established in his name at Dover AFB specifically recognizes cultural awareness and teamwork—values that Durham championed and that continue to shape the military's approach to diversity.

5. **Cherokee Freedmen Reconciliation**: Durham's recognition by the Cherokee Nation in 2024 occurred just three years after the formal resolution of the citizenship dispute, making him one of the first Freedmen descendants to receive tribal honors following the 2021 ruling—a symbol of reconciliation and healing.
